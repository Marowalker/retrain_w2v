Oxidative
stress is implicated in many diseases yet no simple,
rapid, and robust measurement is available at the point-of-care to
assist clinicians in detecting oxidative stress. Here, we report results
from a discovery-based research approach in which a redox mediator
is used to probe serum samples for chemical information relevant to
oxidative stress. Specifically, we use an iridium salt (K2IrCl6) to probe serum for reducing activities that can
transfer electrons to iridium and thus generate detectable optical
and electrochemical signals. We show that this Ir-reducing assay can
detect various biological reductants and is especially sensitive to
glutathione (GSH) compared to alternative assays. We performed an
initial clinical evaluation using serum from 10 people diagnosed with
schizophrenia, a mental health disorder that is increasingly linked
to oxidative stress. The measured Ir-reducing capacity was able to
discriminate people with schizophrenia from healthy controls (p < 0.005), and correlations were observed between Ir-reducing
capacity and independent measures of symptom severity.

==== Body
Increasing
evidence links oxidative
stress to the development of various diseases that include cancer,
cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and neuropsychiatric
diseases.1−4 The goal of this work is to develop a simple, rapid, objective measure
of oxidative stress useful for both researchers and clinicians.5 To develop this method, we used a discovery-driven
approach that is based on two underlying assumptions. First, we assume
that chemical information on oxidative stress is present in serum
and can be accessed by appropriate measurements. As suggested in Scheme 1a, chemical information
on oxidative stress could include the oxidants believed to be responsible
for damage (e.g., reactive oxygen and nitrogen species), the endogenously
generated protective antioxidants (e.g., GSH and ascorbic acid), proteins
involved in inflammation and protection (e.g., cytokines and defense
enzymes),6,7 or the damage associated with oxidative
stress (e.g., lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation).8,9

Scheme 1 Redox Probing to Access Chemical Information of Oxidative Stress
(a) Chemical information relevant
to oxidative stress in blood. (b) The redox-mediator (K2IrCl6, IrOX) is used to probe for reducing
activities and reports this information through optical and electrochemical
modalities.

Traditional approaches to access
chemical information on oxidative
stress focus on chemically specific analytical methods (e.g., HPLC
and mass spectrometry).8,9 Such instrument-intensive methods
will likely be critical for researchers to unravel the detailed molecular
mechanisms responsible for oxidative stress and to guide the development
of future therapeutic interventions. However, these instrument-intensive
measures do not lend themselves to the rapid, inexpensive, point-of-care
analysis that could assist clinicians in diagnosing disease or tailoring
treatments for today’s patients. Generally, clinicians rely
on simpler tools that measure global (not chemically specific) indicators
of a patient’s health. Examples of such global indicators come
from physical measurements of body temperature, blood pressure, and
heart rate. The goal of this work is to develop a simple, rapid method
capable of probing the chemical information in serum to provide a
global indicator of oxidative stress.10−12

The idea of probing
a sample’s chemical information to provide
a single integrated global measure is well-established in the food
industry where antioxidant capacity assays are routinely used to compare
the potential health beneficial activities of different foods.13−15 Variations of these antioxidant capacity assays are also being investigated
for clinical analysis of oxidative stress, but each method has weaknesses
when applied for serum analysis.10,13,16

The second assumption in our discovery-driven
approach is that
chemical signatures (i.e., biomarkers) of oxidative stress are accessible
to measurements of redox activities. Historically, oxidative stress
was believed to result from damage caused by reactive oxygen species
(and other reactive species) and analytical measurements focused on
detecting these chemical species, their generation, and consumption.7,17,18 However, emerging evidence indicates
that oxidative stress is more nuanced than simply free radical damage,
which may explain the general failure of therapeutic interventions
that target free radicals.19−21 More recently, oxidative stress
has been viewed as an imbalance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant
activities,21−23 and sulfur-containing molecules (e.g., thiols) have
emerged as integral chemical components in oxidative stress.22,24,25 Glutathione (GSH) is obviously
linked to oxidative stress because oxidation of this sulfur-containing
chemical species is a major physiological mechanism of antioxidant
protection. However, the oxidation/reduction of the cysteine based
sulfur switches in regulatory proteins provides the mechanisms for
redox-based signals to be transduced into downstream cellular responses.26,27 Because free radicals are not obligatory intermediates in thiol
oxidation, emerging theories characterize oxidative stress in terms
of redox homeostasis and dysregulation.28−30 Assuming redox dysregulation
is the underlying basis of oxidative stress, then we suggest: (i)
redox-probing may be able to access relevant information on oxidative
stress; (ii) redox-probing at a global level (vs measuring individual
chemical components) may provide broader access to the relevant information
on redox context; and (iii) a discovery-based approach is needed to
identify relevant chemical signatures of oxidative stress (there are
currently no validated hypotheses and biomarkers of oxidative stress).
In essence, this second assumption states that while the chemical
evidence of oxidative stress is of an unknown nature, it is accessible
to a redox measurement.

Using these two assumptions and a discovery-based
research approach,
we developed a new method to probe for redox-information in serum
samples. Scheme 1b
illustrates that our method uses a redox-mediator to probe a serum
sample for chemical information on oxidative stress.11 Low molecular weight, diffusible mediators are commonly
used to access redox-active sites of insoluble macromolecules31,32 and internal redox centers of globular proteins (e.g., for mediated
biosensing).33Scheme 1b shows that we selected K2IrCl6(IV) (designated IrOX) as our mediator. IrOx is a reasonably strong oxidant34,35 and has been shown to accept electrons from a broad range of biologically
relevant reductants36 including GSH,37 ascorbate,38 and
cysteine.39 The transfer of electrons from
reducing species in serum to the IrOX mediator can generate
both optical and electrochemical signals which are particularly convenient
for rapid, point-of-care analysis.

Initially, we studied buffered
solutions and observed that this
Ir-reducing assay is sensitive to relevant bioreductants and especially
to GSH. In subsequent studies with serum samples, we evaluated whether
the Ir-reducing assay could provide clinically useful information
for subjects diagnosed with a disease that is linked to oxidative
stress. Specifically, we investigated correlations between the Ir-reduction
values in serum and clinical measures of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia
is a lifelong mental health disorder affecting about 1% of the world
population,40 and increasing evidence links
redox dysregulation and oxidative stress to the pathophysiology of
schizophrenia.41−43 We show that the Ir-reducing assay can discriminate
people diagnosed with schizophrenia from healthy controls (p < 0.005; AUC, 0.92) as well as correlate to subjective
clinical measures of disease severity. We envision that the Ir-reducing
assay could provide a simple, rapid tool that accesses chemical information
on oxidative stress to guide both researchers and clinicians to better
understand and manage oxidative stress disorders.

Results
Assay Development
Qualitative
Validation of Redox Probe
We used K2IrCl6(IV), designated IrOX, to probe
our serum samples for redox information. As illustrated in Figure 1a, IrOX is a yellowish iridium(IV) complex that becomes colorless upon reduction
to iridium(III), designated IrRED. As suggested in Figure 1a, the basis of our
method is that we add IrOX to our serum sample to probe
for reducing activities in the serum. Such reduction reactions can
be detected by attenuations in either an optical signal associated
with the loss of the yellow color or an electrical signal associated
with a subsequent electrochemical titration of the remaining IrOX.

Figure 1 Qualitative validation of Ir-reducing assay. (a) Scheme shows that
the IrOX mediator reports reducing activities of a sample
as attenuations in optical and electrochemical signals. (b) Optical
signal (absorbance) attenuation and (c) electrochemical signal (reductive
charge) attenuation of IrOX in the presence of a reduced
glutathione (GSH). (d) Observed signal attenuations of IrOX when incubated with various reductants (measurements were performed
in quadruplicate and error bars indicate standard deviation).

Attenuation of the optical signal
is illustrated in Figure 1b, which shows IrOX (0.5 mM) has two strong absorbance
peaks at 420 and 488 nm and these
peaks are absent in the spectrum for IrRED. (Figure S1
of Supporting Information provides further
details of this optical measurement.) Addition of the biological reductant
glutathione (GSH; 60 μM) to the IrOX solution and
incubation for 30 min was observed to attenuate this optical signal.
(Figure S2 of Supporting Information shows
attenuation is nearly complete after 30 min incubation.)

Attenuation
of the electrochemical signal associated with the reduction
of IrOX is illustrated in Figure 1c. For these measurements, a sample containing
of IrOX (≈100 μL) was dropped onto the surface
of a screen-printed 3 electrode system. Screen-printed electrodes
were chosen because they are convenient, inexpensive, sensitive, and
portable and thus are suitable for a point-of-care analysis.44 Reduction of IrOX is achieved using
a constant imposed potential of 0 V vs Ag/AgCl. Figure 1c shows the reductive charge transfer for
IrOX as measured by this chronocoulometry method. (Figure
S3 of Supporting Information provides further
details of this electrochemical measurement.) While solution containing
the oxidized IrOX shows a high reductive charge transfer
after 1 min (Q ≈ 80 mC), the solution containing
the reduced IrRED shows minimal charge transfer (Q ≈ 1 mC). Figure 1c shows that the addition of GSH to the IrOX solution and incubation for 30 min leads to an attenuation of the
reductive charge transfer.

The equations in Figure 1d show how we quantified attenuation
of the optical signal
(absorbance at 488 nm) and electrochemical signal (reductive charge
transfer, Q, after 1 min at 0 V). Figure 1d also shows experimental results
for the signal attenuation associated with various components. The
reductant GSH shows the largest signal attenuation while the oxidized
form of GSH, GSSG, shows the lowest signal attenuation (∼6%
of GSH attenuation). Uric acid and ascorbic acid are common reductants
in blood and they showed intermediate signal attenuation. Figure 1d also shows comparatively
small signal attenuation for the commonly used antioxidant standard
trolox.

In summary, Figure 1 provides initial evidence that IrOX can
probe for redox
information (e.g., the presence of reductants in a sample) and can
report this information as an attenuation of signals through two separate
modalities (optical and electrochemical). Importantly, the results
in Figure 1d show good
agreement in the measured attenuations between these two modalities.

Quantitative Validation
Intuitively, the reduction
of IrOX and attenuation of the signals are expected to
be linearly dependent on the concentration of reductants in the sample.
To test this expectation, we mixed IrOX (0.5 mM) with varying
concentrations of individual reductant, incubated for 30 min and measured
signal attenuation. Figure 2a shows that attenuation of the optical signal increased linearly
with concentration for various reductants. Similarly, Figure 2b shows attenuation of the
electrochemical signal is linearly dependent on the reductant concentration.
The slopes of the plots of Figure 2a,b provide a measure of the reductant’s ability
to reduce IrOX and this Ir-reducing capacity follows the
trend GSH ≫ uric acid ≈ ascorbic acid > trolox for
both
the optical and electrochemical measurements. (Figure S4 of Supporting Information provides further details
of these measurements, and Figure S4f also
shows that at higher reductant concentrations signal attenuation is
complete and no longer sensitive to reductant levels).

attenuation and (b) electrochemical signal attenuation relative to
the concentration of individual reductants. (c) Consumed IrOX to oxidize individual reductant versus concentration of reductants.

+0.99). Measurements were performed in quadruplicate and error bars

Table 1 lists
proposed
reactions associated with the reduction of IrOX by the
various reductants. In the absence of O2, it has been reported
that the predominant IrOX oxidation of GSH is a 6 electron
transfer to generate sulfonate (GSO3–), while minor amounts of the oxidized disulfide (GSSG) are formed.37,45−47 (Figure S5 of Supporting Information shows GSH oxidation reactions that have been proposed to explain
these stoichiometries). In the presence of O2, experimental
measurements showed the transfer of 4.2 electrons from GSH to IrOX although no reactions were proposed.37 This stoichiometric value of 4.2 is similar to the value
of ∼4.5 observed in Figure 2c (Figure S6 of Supporting Information provides further details of these calculations).37 For the case of ascorbic acid (AA), Table 1 shows a 2 electron transfer to IrOX was reported,38 which is also consistent
with our calculated value (∼2.2) observed in Figure 2c.

The correlation between the optical
and electrochemical signals
is shown in Figure 2d, which shows a cross-plot of the attenuation percentages for the
two modalities. As expected, there is a strong linear correlation
in the attenuation of these two signals (correlation coefficient, r = 0.995).

Comparison with Other Methods
Several
commercial methods
have been developed to measure the global reducing capacity of a sample.14,15 These methods are based on the electron transfer from reductants
in a sample to an added oxidant (probe), which causes a color change
of the probe. We performed measurements with one standard commercial
method, the cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) assay, to
compare with our Ir-reduction method because the CUPRAC method has
recently been used to measure total antioxidant activities in serum.48 As shown in Figure 3a, this commercial assay is based on a sample’s
ability to transfer electrons to a colorless Cu(II) (CuOX) solution to generate a purple-colored Cu(I) (CuRED).
The color change associated with this reaction is monitored by measuring
the absorbance at 570 nm. In contrast to our Ir-reducing assay where
the signals are attenuated in the presence of reductant, the optical
signals for the Cu-reducing assay increase in the presence of reductants.

Figure 3 Comparison
of Ir-reducing assay with other methods. (a) Scheme
illustrating commercial Cu-reducing assay. (b) Optical signal (absorbance)
of CuOX when incubated with various reductants. (c) Optical
signal increase of CuOX relative to the concentration of
individual reductants. (d) GSH sensitivity of Ir-reduction assay compared
with other methods (data from Ir-reduction and Cu-reduction assays
were experimentally measured while the best fit lines were from Cao
et al. (1998).49 Measurements in parts
b–d were performed in triplicate (all error bars indicate standard
deviation).

Figure 3b shows
the optical response (absorbance at 570 nm) when the CuOX probe was mixed with various reductants and incubated for 30 min.
As expected, the reduced glutathione (GSH) shows a positive response
in this assay while the oxidized glutathione (GSSG) shows no response. Figure 3b also shows the
optical response of CuOX varied depending on the reductant
tested. For instance, ascorbic acid showed the highest response in
this Cu-reduction assay.

To quantitatively measure the reducing
capacity of various reductants,
we mixed the CuOX probe with varying concentrations of
an individual reductant, incubated for 30 min and measured the absorbance
at 570 nm. As expected, Figure 3c shows the optical response is proportional to the concentration
of reductant being tested. (Figure S7 of Supporting Information provides further details of these measurements.)
As observed in Figure 2, the slopes in the plot of Figure 3c can be related to a reductant’s reducing capacity.
With the Cu-reduction assay, ascorbic acid has the highest reducing
capacity and GSH has the lowest with the following trend: ascorbic
acid > uric acid ≈ trolox > GSH. This trend is different
than
that observed with our Ir-reduction assay (Figure 2). Thus, despite the fact that both assays
are based on an electron-transfer reduction mechanism, the redox probes
(IrOX or CuOX) have differing sensitivities
for accepting electrons from reductants.

In addition to the
Cu-reduction assay, several other global assays
have been developed to assess a sample’s total antioxidant
activities. These methods have been prominently applied to foods to
provide a single-value measure of antioxidant activities for the purpose
of understanding and comparing health beneficial properties of foods.14,15 These methods have also been extended to clinical samples in an
effort to provide a quantitative measure useful for characterizing
oxidative stress.10,49,50 Typically, these assays are based on either a hydrogen atom transfer
(HAT) or electron transfer (ET) mechanism.14,15,48 HAT-based assays measure the ability of
an antioxidant to scavenge free radicals by hydrogen donation and
these methods include oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and
total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP). In ET-based assays,
the reducing capacity of reductants in a sample is measured by transferring
an electron from the reductant to an oxidant probe that could be metals,
carbonyls, and radicals.15 The widely used
ET-based assays are the trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC)
assay, the ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay, the N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine
(DMPD) assay, and the Cu-reduction (CUPRAC) assay of Figure 3a.

Figure 3d shows
the sensitivity of these various antioxidant assays to GSH. The Ir-reducing
assay, using either the optical or electrochemical signals, shows
comparatively high sensitivity to GSH compared to commercial Cu-reducing
(CUPRAC) assay. Previous literature reports provided a comparison
of the GSH-sensitivity for the ORAC, TEAC, and FRAP methods, and the
best-fit lines from these studies are also shown in Figure 3d.49 These lines show that these standard methods have a comparatively
low sensitivity for GSH, which is also consistent with reports that
the FRAP assay has low sensitivity for detecting thiols in biological
fluids.15 One possible explanation for
the greater sensitivity of the Ir-reducing assay for GSH is the more
oxidative redox potential of the IrOX mediator. Table 2 lists the redox potentials
for each redox probe (i.e., oxidant) for the various reducing capacity
assays. It is important to note however that thermodynamic explanations
based on redox potentials may not be sufficient to explain differences
in these methods because there can be significant kinetic barriers
to electron transfer reactions. For instance, Figure 3d shows the FRAP assay is unable to detect
GSH despite the fact that the Fe(III) oxidant has a more oxidative
redox potential compared to that for the Cu(II) oxidant of the CUPRAC
method that is able to detect GSH.

In
summary, the Ir-reducing assay uses IrOX as an oxidative
probe and reports information through either optical or electrochemical
modalities. This method can detect reducing-activities from various
reductants and is especially sensitive to GSH. GSH (and thiols in
general) are believed to be important endogenous biological antioxidants
yet these compounds are rather sluggish in transferring electrons
and thus methods to detect biothiols often require special mediators
(i.e., oxidative probes) or nanoparticles for their oxidation.51−55 Not surprisingly, conventional antioxidant capacity assays developed
for food applications are rather insensitive to GSH: phenolics and
ascorbate (not thiols) are considered to be the important food antioxidants
and thus special attention to GSH was not required for developing
antioxidant measures for food analysis. For clinical applications,
however, the high GSH-sensitivity of the Ir-reducing assay may be
an especially important asset when probing serum samples for redox
information on oxidative stress.

Clinical Testing
The underlying hypotheses of this
study are that (i) blood serum contains chemical information on oxidative
stress, and (ii) this chemical information can be accessed by a global
(i.e., chemically nonspecific) method of redox probing.10 Directly testing these hypotheses is currently
impossible because of the ill-defined nature of oxidative stress,
as well as uncertainties of which individual chemical species are
the best markers of oxidative stress. Initial support for these hypotheses
is provided by an experiment in which serum was treated with an oxidative
stressor (i.e., H2O2) and the change of its
reducing capacity was measured. Figure S8 of Supporting Information shows that the addition of oxidative stressor (0.5
mM H2O2) decreased the reducing capacity of
serum by up to 50%, which might be associated with the oxidation of
amino acids by this stressor.56−58 The focus of our study is a less
direct, but potentially more important, test of these hypotheses by
evaluating correlations between measurements from our Ir-reduction
assay and independent clinical measures of disease. For this, we measured
serum samples from ten people diagnosed with schizophrenia and five
healthy controls, and we evaluated possible correlations with clinical
measures of disease (note: as in previous measurements, O2 was not excluded during serum analysis). Growing evidence suggests
oxidative stress plays an important role in schizophrenia.43,59−61 Importantly, no independent blood tests are currently
widely used by clinicians to assist in diagnosing or evaluating the
treatment response of schizophrenia.62

Comparison
of Schizophrenia and Healthy Control Groups
In initial studies,
we removed proteins from serum by filtering the
serum using a centrifugal membrane filter (molecular weight cutoff
= 10 kDa), diluted the filtrate 10-fold with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS), and then analyzed the diluted filtrate by both the commercial
Cu-reduction assay and the Ir-reduction assay (with both optical and
electrochemical detection). Analysis of serum filtrates is expected
to detect reducing contributions from low molecular weight components
of serum such as ascorbic acid (AA), α-tocopherol, β-carotene,
ubiquinol, glutathione (GSH), uric acid (UA), and bilirubin.49,63 For comparison purposes, we normalized reducing capacity in terms
of trolox equivalents, which is the common standard used for antioxidant
reducing assays.15Figure 4a compares the serum filtrate’s reducing
capacity between the schizophrenia and control groups. The commercial
Cu-reducing assay shows no differences between these serum filtrates
(p = 0.54), while the Ir-reducing assay shows serum
filtrates from healthy controls have nonsignificant but higher average
reducing capacity compared to those from the schizophrenia group (p = 0.23).

Figure 4 Clinical testing of reducing capacity of healthy control
and schizophrenia
groups. (a) Reducing capacity of filtered serum and (b) serum for
healthy control (N = 5) and schizophrenia (N = 10) groups. Reducing capacity was measured by the commercial
Cu-reduction method and the Ir-reduction method with both electrochemical
and optical detection. (c) Measurement of total sulfhydryl groups
(−SH) in serum samples of healthy control and schizophrenia
groups. (d) Correlation between total sulfhydryl groups and Ir-reducing
capacity (electrochemical detection) of serum sample (N = 15, r = +0.57, p = 0.026). (e)

sulfhydryls assay for diagnosis of the schizophrenia group from the
healthy control group. (f) Correlation between Ir-reducing capacities
measured electrochemically and optically (N = 15, r= +0.96). Measurements in parts a–c were performed
in quadruplicate (error bars indicate standard deviation).

In addition to measuring serum filtrates, we performed
measurements
on serum after diluting the serum 1000-fold with PBS (Figure S9 of
the Supporting Information shows that after
1000-fold dilution, the serum absorbance approaches that of the buffer
background). Figure 4b shows that when these serum samples were evaluated by the commercial
Cu-reducing assay, no significant differences were observed between
schizophrenia and control groups (p = 0.63). In contrast,
results from the Ir-reducing assay show considerably higher reducing
capacities for serum from control group compared to serum from the
schizophrenia group (p < 0.005). Also, the Ir-reducing
assay with serum (Figure 4b) showed greater discriminating abilities compared to results
with filtered serum (Figure 4a).

One possible explanation for the ability of the
Ir-reducing assay
to detect differences between the control and schizophrenia groups
(compared to the commercial Cu-reducing assay), is the greater sensitivity
of the Ir-reducing assay to sulfhydryl groups as observed in Figure 3d. To evaluate this
possibility, we assayed serum for total sulfhydryl groups (e.g., GSH
and protein sulfhydryls) using a modified Ellman’s method.64−66Figure 4c shows that
the serum from control group has higher sulfhydryl values compared
to serum from the schizophrenia group. Figure 4d shows a modest positive correlation (N = 15, r = +0.57, p =
0.026) between total sulfhydryl group assay and the Ir-reducing capacity
as measured electrochemically. [Note: for clarity, error bars are
not shown in Figure 4d but are shown in Figure S10 of the Supporting Information.] This correlation indicates that the higher Ir-reducing
capacity is modestly related to higher levels of total sulfhydryls.
Thus, it appears that the higher sulfhydryl content in the serum from
healthy controls is partially responsible for the higher measured
Ir-reducing capacity.

We characterized the clinical diagnostic
performance of our assay
using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to
determine if the measurements could discern the schizophrenia group
from the healthy controls.62,67,68 In this method, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for a perfect
diagnostic test would be 1.0 while a random test would yield a value
of 0.5. As shown in Figure 4e, the calculated AUC values for the Ir-reducing capacity
assay (with electrochemical detection) for serum was determined to
be 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76–1.08; p = 0.01), which compares to the value of 0.6 for the Cu-reducing
serum assay (95% CI, 0.26–0.94; p = 0.54)
and 0.86 for the Ellman’s free sulfhydryl group assay of serum
(95% CI, 0.63–1.09; p = 0.03). Thus, this
analysis provides additional support that the Ir-reducing assay accesses
clinically useful chemical information. (Figure S11 of the Supporting Information provides further details
of ROC curves.)

To further evaluate the Ir-reducing assay results
for serum samples
(Figure 4b), we prepared
a cross-plot between optical and electrochemical measurements. Figure 4f shows a strong
correlation between these two independent measurement modalities (N = 15, r = +0.96) even in serum analysis.
[Note: for clarity, error bars are not shown in Figure 4f but are shown in Figure S12 of the Supporting Information]

In summary, the
results in Figure 4 indicate that the Ir-reducing capacity measurements
with diluted serum can distinguish the schizophrenia group from the
control group. The lower observed reducing activities in the serum
of the schizophrenia group is consistent with suggestions that oxidative
stress is linked to schizophrenia.43,59 While this
initial test of Ir-reducing assay is promising, a larger sized sample
will be required to support clinical conclusions.

Ir-Reducing
Capacity Correlations to Age and Disease Severity
The original
free radical theory of aging hypothesized that aging
results from cumulative damage associated with free radicals69 and several studies have established correlations
between age and various markers of oxidative damage.70,71 If the Ir-reducing assay accesses important chemical information
on oxidative stress, then we would expect correlations between age
and Ir-reducing capacity. As expected, Figure 5a,b shows inverse correlations between age
and Ir-reducing capacity for the individual schizophrenia and control
groups as well as for the overall population of both groups. Importantly,
the boxed regions in Figure 5b show that if an age cutoff of 50 years is applied to our
data, the Ir-reducing assay can fully distinguish the schizophrenia
group from healthy controls (p < 0.05). Specifically,
the two overlapping data points in Figure 4f are for the oldest healthy controls.

Figure 5 Correlation
of Ir-reducing capacity with age and symptom severity.
(a) Correlations between Ir-reducing capacity assay (electrochemical
detection) and age or symptoms as measured by the brief psychiatric
rating scale (BPRS). (b) Correlation between of Ir-reducing capacity
and age for healthy control and schizophrenia groups. (c) Correlation
between Ir-reducing capacity and anxiety/depression symptom. (d) Correlation
between Ir-reducing capacity and positive (psychosis) symptom.

Potentially, the Ir-reducing assay
is accessing chemical information
on oxidative stress that is related to the severity of symptoms in
people with schizophrenia, and thus correlations might be expected
between Ir-reduction capacity and independent clinical measures of
symptom severity. The most widely used scale for measuring psychotic
symptoms is the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), which is based
on a clinician’s interview and observations of the patient.72 The BPRS scale considers several items, and
higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. Figure 5a shows statistical information for correlations
between these composite psychotic symptoms and Ir-reducing capacity
for the 10 persons in the schizophrenia group. As expected, most symptoms
show a negative correlation between symptom severity and Ir-reduction
capacity (i.e., greater symptom severity is correlated to greater
oxidative stress). The strongest correlation was observed between
anxiety/depression and Ir-reducing capacity (N =
10, r = −0.74, p = 0.015)
in Figure 5c, while
the weakest correlation was observed for the negative symptom. The
positive symptom (psychosis) also showed a high correlation between
symptom severity and Ir-reducing capacity (N = 10, r = −0.64, p = 0.048) in Figure 5d.

In summary,
the initial clinical results in Figure 5 further support a conclusion that the Ir-reduction
assay accesses chemical information that could be useful for understanding
and managing diseases that are believed to be linked to oxidative
stress.

Discussion
Clinicians routinely
assess patients using simple physical measurements
that provide global information in a timely manner (e.g., measurements
of temperature, pulse and blood pressure). Blood contains valuable
chemical information on a patient’s health, and blood tests
are routinely used to access specific chemical information (e.g.,
of individual metabolites, antibodies, or biomarkers). For the case
of oxidative stress, a focus on specific (vs global) chemical information
may be less helpful to clinicians for two reasons. First, acquiring
specific chemical information often requires specialized instrumentation
in centralized laboratories which generally means this chemical information
is not available in a timely manner. Second, for the case of oxidative
stress, it is not clear what specific chemical information is most
relevant. As a result, for diseases such as schizophrenia, clinicians
do not even use chemical information for diagnosis or assessment.
Here, we report a method to access global chemical information on
oxidative stress. While the development of this method was guided
by chemical/medical intuition (e.g., a requirement for high GSH sensitivities),
this method is not chemically specific but more broadly probes for
redox-information. Initial clinical evaluations indicate this method
may access valuable chemical information while the speed and simplicity
of the method suggests this information could be available at the
point-of-care.

In addition to providing timely chemical information
at the point-of-care,
we believe there is a second potential advantage of the Ir-reducing
assay. If this measurement proves to be a reliable indicator to assist
in the diagnosis and assessment of symptom severity, then these measurements
could become an important investigational tool. For instance, this
measurement could provide clinical researchers with a readily measurable
objective target to assess therapeutic interventions. Alternatively,
experimental research to unravel the chemical basis of the Ir-reduction
signal could discover clues of the molecular mechanisms important
in oxidative stress. Such a “reverse engineering” of
the Ir-reduction signal could provide a complementary approach to
alternative, instrument-intensive discovery approaches (i.e., -omic
based methods). In summary, we believe the Ir-reduction assay could
be important because it provides simple near-real-time access to important
global chemical information in serum.

Conclusions
Here
we report a simple, rapid, and robust method to probe serum
for chemical information relevant to oxidative stress. This iridium-reducing
assay uses K2IrCl6 (IrOX) as a redox
mediator to detect the serum’s reducing activities and can
detect this activity by independent optical and electrochemical modalities.
Compared to alternative global reducing assays, the Ir-reducing assay
has a high sensitivity to GSH which is an especially important attribute
for probing serum for information on oxidative stress. Initial clinical
evaluations show that the Ir-reducing assay can discern a schizophrenia
group (N = 10) from healthy controls (N = 5, p < 0.005) and showed an inverse correlation
between reducing activities and the severity of the anxiety/depression
(N = 10, r = −0.74, p = 0.015) and psychosis symptoms (N =
10, r = −0.64, p = 0.048)
for the schizophrenia group. In conclusion, the Ir-reducing assay
accesses global chemical information on oxidative stress with the
sensitivity, speed, and simplicity required for point-of-care measurement.
Potentially, this chemical measurement could complement other global
physical measures (e.g., temperature and blood pressure) used routinely
for the rapid clinical evaluation of a patient’s status.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
The following were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich:
K2IrCl6 (IV), K3IrCl6 (III),
glutathione (reduced, GSH), glutathione (oxidized, GSSG), ascorbic
acid, uric acid, 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB),
phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The water (>18 MΩ) used
in
this study was obtained from a Super Q water system (Millipore). A
stock solution of 0.5 mM K2IrCl6(IV) was prepared
in PBS (pH 7.4).

Serum Samples and Symptom Assessment
Recruitment of
people to participate in a clinical study designed to collect blood
samples occurred between May 2015 and August 2016. Blood samples were
collected from the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, University
of Maryland School of Medicine. We recruited two populations, people
with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder
and a population of individuals without a major psychiatric diagnosis.
All participants completed data collection procedures in a single
1–2 h study visit. Additionally, participants provided detailed
clinical information. Blood samples (45 mL) were collected using 6
tubes of BD Vacutainers and centrifuged at 3000 rpm. The resulting
supernatant was removed using disposable plastic 1 mL pipets. It was
apportioned into 1 mL aliquots and stored at −80 °C in
a freezer before analysis. To assay serum, the frozen serum was thawed
at room temperature in the air for 30 min and then it was kept in
an ice bath before the measurement.

The study to collect human
serum from people with schizophrenia and healthy controls was approved
by the University of Maryland School of Medicine IRB, and informed
consent was obtained from all study participants prior to the research
procedure.

A trained interviewer interviewed the people with
schizophrenia
to assess the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), a clinical evaluation
that rapidly provides measurement of clinical symptoms. The BPRS total
score as well as five domain scores are calculated (positive, negative,
anxiety/depression, hostility, and activation).

Research staff
tasked with the collection of biological samples
and protected health information have completed the requisite training
and implemented standard procedures as required by The State of Maryland
Department of Mental Health and Hygiene (DHMH) and the University
of Maryland School of Medicine. Informed consent was obtained from
each participant after reviewing relevant risks and benefits for the
project. Successful completion of the Evaluation to Sign Consent was
also required to demonstrate participant understanding of the voluntary
nature of research, study tasks, and risks. The respective Institutional
Review Boards for the University of Maryland and DHMH have approved
this project and specified its conduct as having minimal risk to research
participants.

Instrumentation
Electrochemical
measurements (cyclic
voltammetry (CV)) and chronocoulometry (CC)) were performed to measure
the electrochemical signal (CHI420a electrochemical analyzer, CHInstruments,
TX). For the electrochemical assay, we used a screen-printed carbon
paste electrode (CHInstruments, TX) with carbon working and counter
electrodes, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The optical signal
was recorded using a microplate reader (SperctraMax M2, Molecular
Devices, CA).

Ir-Reducing Capacity Assay in Buffer
A stock solution
of 10 mM K2IrCl6 and stock solutions of ascorbic
acid (1 mM) and glutathione (GSH, 1 mM), oxidized glutathione (GSSG,
1 mM), trolox (1 mM) and uric acid (0.4 mM) were prepared in 0.1 M
PBS (pH 7.4). A portion of each antioxidant stock solution was added
into a 96 well-plate to generated 0 (blank), 20 μM, 40 μM,
60 μM, 80 μM, 100 μM antioxidant solutions. The
0.1 M PBS was added to each well to bring the volume to 95 μL.
In each well, 5 μL of 10 mM K2IrCl6 (final
concentration 0.5 mM) was added, mixed by pipetting and incubated
for 30 min at room temperature. After that, the absorbance was measured
at 488 nm using a microplate reader (optical measurement). For an
electrochemical measurement, 100 μL of the mixture from each
well was dropped onto a screen-printed electrode by covering all of
the electrodes (working, counter, and reference electrodes). A constant
potential of 0 V was applied to the electrode, and the charge was
measured for 1 min using a chronocoulometry technique. All data shown
in Figure 1 and Figure 2 were averaged from
the measurements in quadruplicate, and the error bar indicates standard
deviation (s.d.).

Ir-Reducing Capacity Assay in Filtered Serum
For a
reducing capacity assay in filtered serum, microcon centrifugal filter
device (EMD Millipore, MA) was used to remove biomacromolecues (MW
> 10 kDa) from serum. Serum was pipetted into the device and the
assembly
was placed in a centrifuge (Centrifuge 5415c, Eppendorf) and spun
at 14 000g. The filtrate was used for reducing
capacity assay. A volume of 10 μL of filtered serum was added
into a 96 well plate containing 85 μL of 0.1 M PBS, and then
5 μL of 10 mM K2IrCl6 was added to each
well (this procedure results in a 10-fold dilution of the filtered
serum). After adding the filtrate, buffer, and mediator, the solution
was mixed by pipetting and incubated for 30 min at room temperature.
The optical and electrochemical responses were measured as described
above.

Ir-Reducing Capacity Assay in Serum
For a reducing
capacity assay in serum, serum was first diluted 20-fold with 0.1
M PBS and 2 μL of diluted serum was added into a 96 well plate
containing 93 μL of 0.1 M PBS, and then 5 μL of 10 mM
K2IrCl6 solution was added to each well (this
procedure results in an overall 1000-fold dilution of the filtered
serum). After adding the solutions, mixing by pipetting and incubating
for 30 min at room temperature, the optical response and electrochemical
response were measured as described above. All data shown in Figure 4 were averaged from
the quadruplicate measurements and the error bar indicates standard
deviation.

Cu-Reducing Capacity Assay
To compare
the reducing
capacity measured with our method, a commercial reducing capacity
assay was performed (cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC)
assay, MAK187 from Sigma-Aldrich). To measure the reducing capacity
of the sample, a portion of sample was added into a 96 well-plate
and water was added to each well to bring the volume to 50 μL.
In each well, 50 μL of Cu(II) working solution provided in an
assay kit was added, mixed by pipetting and incubated for 30 min at
room temperature. After incubation, the absorbance was measured at
570 nm using a microplate reader (optical measurement). All data shown
in Figure 3 were averaged
from the triplicate measurements, and the error bar indicates standard
deviation.

Measurement of Total Sulfhydryl Groups of
Serum Samples
Total sulfhydryl groups of serum samples were
assayed according to
manufacturer’s instructions (Quantification of Sulfhydryls,
Uptima, Interchim). A dilution buffer (30 mM Tris HCl, 3 mM EDTA,
pH 8.2) and DTNB working solution (3 mM in methanol) were prepared.
As a standard for the free sulfhydryl group (−SH) assay, we
prepared GSH solutions (0.1 mM to ∼1 mM in dilution buffer).
A volume of 20 μL of sample or standard solution, 75 μL
of dilution buffer, 25 μL of DTNB reagent, and 400 μL
of methanol were added into a microcentrifuge tube. After 5 min incubation,
the mixture was centrifuged at 3000g for 5 min at
room temperature. The supernatant was transferred into a microplate.
The optical absorbance was measured at 412 nm. All data shown in Figure 4c were averaged from
the quadruplicate measurements, and the error bar indicates standard
deviation.

Statistical Analysis
The calculation
of p-values in Figure 4 was performed using a mixed design analysis of variance
(SPANOVA).
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the antioxidant
assays in Figure 4e
and Figure S11 were determined utilizing
OriginPro (OriginLab Corporation), and values were determined for
area under curve (AUC) as shown in Figure 4, the 95% confidence intervals, and the p-values. Relationships between reducing capacity and age
or BPRS scores in Figure 5 were assessed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. p-values in Figure 5 were obtained from regression analysis (ANOVA). All of the
clinical data in Figure 4 and Figure 5 are
provided in Tables S1–S8 of the Supporting Information.
