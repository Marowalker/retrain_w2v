Thiol groups in biological molecules
play a significant role in
various physiological functions and pathological conditions. Thiols
are divided into two major groups: protein thiols and nonprotein thiols.
Numerous methods have been reported for thiol assays. Most of these
methods have been developed for glutathione, the principal nonprotein
thiol, despite the fact that cellular protein thiols are more abundant
than glutathione. Further, these methods usually involve a process
of biological sample preparation followed by a separation method,
and they are time-consuming. We reported previously a series of thiol-specific
fluorogenic benzofurazan sulfides. These nonfluorescent benzofurazan
sulfides react rapidly and specifically with a thiol to form a strong
fluorescent thiol adduct. The rapid reaction, thiol-specific and fluorogenic
nature of the sulfides successfully yielded an application of one
of the sulfides for relative quantitation of total thiols in live
cells through fluorescence microscopy. In this work, we employed the
same compound to develop the first high-throughput method for simultaneous
monitoring of protein thiols, nonprotein thiols, and total thiols
in cells in a 96-well plate on a fluorescence microplate reader at
λex = 430 nm and λem = 520 nm, respectively.
The method is rapid and sensitive, and has been validated by an HPLC
thiol assay method. The method can detect thiols with cell concentrations
as low as 500 cells/well. We also demonstrated that the method can
readily monitor changes in cellular thiol levels. Although the method
cannot provide an absolute quantification for thiols because fluorescence
intensity of different thiol adducts varies, it provides an accurate
measurement of relative quantification, relative to the control. The
method will be a valuable tool in thiol-related biomedical/pharmaceutical
research.

==== Body
The thiol
functional group (−SH
or sulfhydryl) present in biomolecules plays a significant role in
various physiological functions and pathological conditions through
its nucleophilicity, reduction property, and chelation property.1 Thiol levels in the biological system are affected
by a number of factors2 and are often used
as a parameter to reflect various physiological and pathological states
such as aging and neurodegenerative diseases.3−6 Numerous analytical methods have
been reported to measure thiol levels, mostly glutathione (GSH) levels,
in the biological system.7−13 GSH is a three-amino acid peptide and serves as the major antioxidant
as well as the major endogenous molecule involved in the detoxification
of the biological system.

Thiols in the biological system can
be divided into two major groups:
protein thiols and nonprotein thiols or small molecule thiols. The
nonprotein thiols include GSH, homocysteine, cysteine, and other cysteine-containing
low molecular weight peptides with GSH as the principal nonprotein
thiol. Although most protein thiols are related to protein structure
and function, nonprotein thiols, primarily GSH, serve as the major
redox buffer to maintain a reducing cellular environment. Nonprotein
thiols protect protein structure and function through prevention of
protein thiol oxidation. As a result, nonprotein thiols are more sensitive
to changes in cellular oxidative stress. Most analytical methods for
thiol determination have been developed to measure GSH. The GSH content
is then used to reflect overall thiol status because measurement of
protein thiols is more technically challenging, despite the fact that
they are more abundant than GSH.9,14−16 The analytical methods for GSH usually involve a procedure of biological
sample preparation, GSH derivatization, and use of a separation technique
such as HPLC, capillary electrophoresis (CE), or LC/MS.7−13 Therefore, these analytical methods tend to be time-consuming. In
addition, these methods usually require a relatively large sample
volume. A few high-throughput assays for GSH,17,18 homocysteine and cysteine,19 cysteinylglycine,20 and total thiols with a thiol-selective agent,
5-(bromomethyl)fluorescein,21 have been
reported. However, high-throughput methods for simultaneous measurement
of protein thiols and nonprotein thiols are lacking.

We recently
reported a series of benzofurazan sulfides as thiol-specific
fluorogenic agents.22 These reagents react
rapidly with a thiol through a thiol-specific thiol–sulfide
exchange reaction (Scheme 1). Among these agents,
benzofurazan sulfide 1a (Scheme 1) was employed
for total thiol imaging in live cells. The reagent is now named GUALY’s
reagent. As a fluorogenic agent, GUALY’s reagent itself exhibits
very minimal fluorescence but forms a thiol adduct with strong fluorescence
after reacting with a thiol. The formed fluorescent thiol adducts
derived from reaction with different thiols (protein thiols and nonprotein
thiols) exhibited very similar excitation and emission spectra with
λex and λem at 430 and 520 nm, respectively,
indicating these two wavelengths are appropriate for detection of
various thiols in the biological system.22 With a 1:1 molar ratio, GUALY’s reagent reacts rapidly, within
5 min, with a thiol at ambient temperature while exhibiting no reaction
with other biologically relevant nucleophilic functional groups such
as −NH2, −OH, and −COOH even at a
molar ratio of 50:1.22 The rapid and thiol-specific
reaction, the fluorogenic nature of GUALY’s reagent, and a
large Stokes effect (∼100 nm) of the fluorescent thiol adducts
has resulted in a successful application of the compound as the first
reagent for total thiol imaging and relative quantification in live
cells through fluorescence microscopy.22

Scheme 1 Thiol-Specific Reaction of the Benzofurazan Sulfides22
In the present work,
we employed GUALY’s reagent to develop
a high-throughput assay in a 96-well plate for protein thiols, nonprotein
thiols, and total thiols in cells. The assay was validated by a reported
HPLC thiol assay method. The assay is rapid, convenient, sensitive,
and reliable, and provides simultaneous monitoring of changes in protein
thiols, nonprotein thiols, and total thiols. It can detect thiols
using cell concentrations as low as 500 cells/well, and the fluorescence
intensity increased linearly over cell numbers ranging from 500 cells/well
to 15 000 cells/well. The assay will be a useful tool in the
study of the physiological functions and pathological conditions of
protein thiols, nonprotein thiols, and total thiols.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Solutions
Benzofurazan sulfide 1a (GUALY’s
reagent) was synthesized according to a literature reported procedure.22 GUALY’s reagent stock solution was prepared
as a 1 mM solution in acetonitrile. GUALY’s reagent derivatizing
solution (0.1 mM) was prepared as a 1:10 (v/v) dilution of the stock
solution in phosphate buffer (0.45 M, pH 7.9) containing 2% SDS. The
cell lysis solution was a solution of 5% (w/v) sulfosalicylic acid
in deionized water containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100.18 The 3% (w/v) sulfosalicylic acid solution was
prepared by dissolving sulfosalicylic acid in deionized water. N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) was prepared as a 5 mM stock solution
in deionized water. Stock solutions of GSH (5 mM), cupric chloride
(0.7 mM), calcium chloride (341 mM), zinc sulfate (4.3 mM), potassium
phosphate (204 mM), magnesium sulfate (91.4 mM), ferrous sulfate (2
mM), and ferric ammonium sulfate (1.2 mM) were prepared in deionized
water. All reagents and solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
unless otherwise specified.

Cell Culture
Exponentially growing
NCI-H226 cells (human
lung cancer) were obtained from the National Cancer Institute and
cultured in RPMI 1640 growth medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100
units/mL penicillin (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) and 100 μg/mL
streptomycin (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon,VA) in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. All cell culture materials
were purchased from Atlanta Biologicals (Flowery Branch, GA) unless
otherwise specified.

Time Required for Thiol Derivatization by
GUALY’s Reagent
NCI-H226 cells in RPMI growth medium
were plated in a 96-well plate
at a density of 15 000 cells/150 μL/well and were allowed
to attach in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at
37 °C for 24 h. The medium was removed, and the wells were washed
with Dulbecco’s Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS) before the
GUALY’s reagent derivatizing solution (100 μL/well) was
added. The plate was covered with aluminum foil and shaken at room
temperature on a microplate shaker at speed 6 for various time points
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, and 15 min) before the fluorescence intensity
was read on a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader using 430 and 520 nm
as λex and λem, respectively, with
a cutoff wavelength at 495 nm.

Cell Number Requirement
and Linearity
NCI-H226 cells
were prepared at a concentration of 100 000 cells/mL in RPMI
growth medium before dispensing to a 96-well plate at densities varying
from 500 cells/150 μL/well to 15 000 cells/150 μL/well.
The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The medium was removed,
and the wells were washed with deionized water twice before the GUALY’s
reagent derivatizing solution (200 μL/well) was added. The plate
was covered with aluminum foil and shaken on a microplate shaker at
speed 6 for 5 min at room temperature before fluorescence determination
as described above.

High-Throughput Assay of Total Thiols, Protein
Thiols, and Nonprotein
Thiols in Cells
Cells at a density of 15 000 cells/150
μL/well in a 96-well plate in RPMI growth medium were allowed
to attach for 24 h. After 24 h, the medium was discarded, and the
attached cells were washed once with DPBS before fresh RPMI growth
medium containing different concentrations of NEM was added. The 96-well
plate was incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 3 h before the medium was removed, and
cells were washed twice with DPBS (150 μL/well). The GUALY’s
reagent derivatizing solution was added to each well in the top four
rows of the plate (100 μL/well) for total thiol determination
while the cell lysis solution was added to the bottom four rows (50
μL/well) for nonprotein thiol and protein thiol determination.
The plate was covered with aluminum foil and shaken at speed 6 for
10 min. The fluorescence intensity of the top four rows was read as
described above. The plate was then centrifuged for 10 min at 4000
rpm (18 g) at 4 °C. The supernatant (∼50 μL/well)
from the bottom four rows was transferred to another 96-well plate
for nonprotein thiol determination. The bottom four rows were washed
with cell lysis buffer (50 μL), shaken for 10 min at speed 6,
and centrifuged at 4000 rpm (18 g) at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant
was discarded to remove any residual nonprotein thiols. Each well
was added with the GUALY’s reagent derivatizing solution (100
μL/well). The fluorescence intensity was obtained as described
above. For the nonprotein thiol plate, each well was added with the
GUALY’s reagent stock solution (20 μL) along with 2%
SDS sodium phosphate buffer (0.5 M, pH 7.9, 130 μL). The plate
was covered with aluminum foil and shaken for 10 min on a microplate
shaker at speed 6 before fluorescence intensity was read as described
above. A work flow diagram for the high-throughput assay is presented
in Figure 1.

assay. (A) Top four rows

in 2% SDS, and thiols were derivatized by GUALY’s reagent followed
by fluorescence determination at λex = 430 nm and
λem = 520 nm. Cells in the bottom four rows were
lysed with the cell lysis solution, centrifuged, and the supernatant
was transferred to plate 2 and derivatized by GUALY’s reagent
for nonprotein thiol determination (D) while the remaining protein
residues in the bottom four rows of plate 1 were washed with cell
lysis buffer to remove nonprotein thiols, redissolved with 2% SDS,
and derivatized by GUALY’s reagent before fluorescence determination
for protein thiols (C).

Validation of the High-Throughput Assay by an HPLC Thiol Assay
Method
i Validation of the High-Throughput Assay for
Protein Thiols and Total Thiols
NCI-H226 cells at a density
of 1.5 × 105 cells/mL in 10 mL of RPMI growth medium
without FBS were transferred to a 15 mL cell culture tube. Different
concentrations of NEM in individual tubes were prepared through the
addition of different volumes of the NEM stock solution (5 mM). The
tube was vortexed, followed by incubation in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2 for 3 h at 37 °C with the tube loosely
capped. The tube was shaken every hour to avoid settling of the cells.
At the end of 3 h, the tube was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min.
The cell pellets were washed with DPBS (2 mL) and centrifuged, and
the DPBS was discarded. An additional 10 mL of DPBS was added to each
tube to resuspend the cells at a concentration of 1.5 × 105 cells/mL. Out of the 10 mL cell suspension, 0.6 mL was dispensed
to a 96-well plate at a density of 15 000 cells/100 μL/well
for six wells with three wells for total thiol determination and three
wells for protein thiol determination as described above. The rest
of the cell suspension (approximately 9.4 mL) was centrifuged at 2500
rpm for 5 min to yield cell pellets. To the collected cell pellets
were added 250 μL of 3% sulfosalicylic acid solution followed
by sonication for 15 min before being transferred to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf
tube for protein thiol and total thiol determination using the HPLC
assay as described below.

HPLC Assay
The HPLC assay for both
total thiols and
protein thiols followed a literature reported procedure.9 Briefly, the 250 μL HPLC sample was divided
into two parts with 100 μL for the total thiol assay and 150
μL for the protein thiol assay. The sample for the total thiol
assay (100 μL) was first derivatized by 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic
acid) (DTNB, Ellman’s reagent) as described below. The sample
for the protein thiol assay (150 μL) was centrifuged at 14 000
rpm for 5 min. The collected protein pellets were washed once with
3% sulfosalicylic acid (200 μL) followed by addition of 3% sulfosalicylic
acid (100 μL) before derivatization by DTNB. For DTNB derivatization,
an aliquot of 25 μL from the above samples was transferred to
a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge vial containing DTNB (19.8 mg/mL, 17.5 μL), p-aminobenzoic acid (10 mg/mL, 25 μL, internal standard),
phosphate buffer (0.15 M, pH 7.5, 280 μL), and HCl (10 M, 12.5
μL) with a total volume of 340 μL. The sample was vortexed
and centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 1 min. The total thiols and
protein thiols were quantified through HPLC quantification of the
released 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB) as reported.9 A work flow diagram for validation of the high-throughput
assay by HPLC is presented in Figure 2.

suspension was dispensed at 15 000 cells/100 μL/well
to a 96-well plate for 6 wells with three wells for total thiol determination
and three wells for protein thiol determination using the high-throughput
assay; (C). 9.4 mL of the 10 mL cell suspension was centrifuged. The
cell pellets were resuspended in 250 μL of 3% sulfosalicylic
acid solution. Out of the 250 μL, 100 μL was used for
total thiol assay (D) by HPLC; and 150 μL was used for protein
thiol assay by HPLC (E).

ii Validation of the High-Throughput
Assay for
Nonprotein Thiols
Validation of the high-throughput assay
for nonprotein thiols by HPLC followed the same procedure as that
for protein thiols and total thiols except lower NEM concentrations
were employed.

Effects of Metal Ions on the Assay
GSH (5 mM, 10 μL)
was added to the GUALY’s reagent derivatizing solution (∼970
μL) followed by addition of a metal stock solution (1.7–24
μL) for a total volume of 1 mL. The solution was covered by
aluminum foil and shaken at room temperature for 10 min. The solution
was transferred to a 96-well plate at a density of 100 μL/well
before the fluorescence intensity was read on a SpectraMax M2 microplate
reader using 430 and 520 nm as λex and λem respectively with a cutoff wavelength at 495 nm.

Results
and Discussion
Experimental Conditions for the High-Throughput
Assay
GUALY’s reagent has been demonstrated to react
rapidly and
specifically with nonprotein thiols, thiols on BSA, and in cell homogenates.22 To ensure all thiols in the cell lysate employed
in this work (15 000 cells/well) would be completely converted
into fluorescent thiol adducts by GUALY’s reagent, a study
to determine the time required for thiol derivatization was conducted.
Cells at a density of 15 000 cells/well in a 96-well plate
were treated with the GUALY’s reagent derivatizing solution
(100 μL/well). The 2% SDS in the GUALY’s reagent derivatizing
solution has been found to effectively and completely lyse the cells
and also dissolve the lysate into a solution, a key for successful
measurement of protein thiols. The plate was covered with aluminum
foil before the fluorescence intensity was read at different time
points over a period of 15 min on a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader.
As presented in Figure 3, the fluorescence
intensity increased over time for up to 3 min, then remained constant
indicating that 3 min were needed to derivatize thiols in the wells
and that the fluorescence intensity is stable for at least 15 min.
On the basis of the results, 10 min were employed for cellular thiol
derivatization for the high-throughput assay.

Figure 3 Reaction time determination
for cell lysate thiol derivatization
by GUALY’s reagent. Cells at a density of 15 000 cells/150
μL/well in a 96-well plate were treated with the GUALY’s
reagent derivatizing solution. The fluorescence intensity was read
on a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader using 430 and 520 nm as λex and λem respectively with a cutoff wavelength
at 495 nm. The data are expressed as the means ± SD from three
wells.

After establishing the thiol derivatization
time, we checked the
cell detection limit and linearity of the assay. Cells in a 96-well
plate ranging from a density of 500 cells/well to 15 000 cells/well
were treated with GUALY’s reagent in the same manner as presented
in the high-throughput assay described below except that NEM treatment
was not conducted. Our results demonstrated that the high-throughput
assay was able to detect protein thiols, nonprotein thiols, and total
thiols with a cell concentration as low as 500 cells/well, and that
the detection was linear over cell densities ranging from 500 cells/well
to 15 000 cells/well. Figure 4 presents
the data derived from nonprotein thiol (A), protein thiol (B), and
total thiol (C) determination. Table 1 is a
tabular presentation of Figure 4. It shows
that the sum of the fluorescence intensity from nonprotein thiols
and protein thiols matched well with the fluorescence intensity observed
from total thiols—an assurance that all thiols in the cells
were completely derivatized by GUALY’s reagent.

in a 96-well plate were treated with the GUALY’s reagent derivatizing
solution before fluorescence reading on a SpectraMax M2 microplate
reader using 430 and 520 nm as λex and λem, respectively, with a cutoff wavelength at 495 nm. The fluorescence
intensity derived from the wells with no cells served as a blank and
was subtracted from the fluorescence intensity of each sample. Each
data point was an average of fluorescence intensity derived from three
wells. The fluorescence intensity is presented as relative fluorescence
units (RFUs). The data are expressed as the means ± SD from three
wells.

Detection of Cellular Thiol Changes by the High-Throughput Assay
Next we investigated whether the high-throughput assay could detect
changes in cellular total thiols, protein thiols, and nonprotein thiols.
NEM was employed to modulate intracellular thiol concentration. NEM
blocks thiols through covalent bond formation and is a common tool
used to modulate thiol concentration.23 To ensure enough latitude for thiol concentration modulation by
NEM, 15 000 cells/well were employed as the cell density in
the experiment. After 24 h of attachment, cells at a density of 15 000
cells/well in a 96-well plate were first treated with various concentrations
of NEM. After the treatment, the top four rows of the 96-well plate
were used for total thiol determination while the bottom four rows
were used for the determination of protein thiols and nonprotein thiols.
The GUALY’s reagent derivatizing solution was added to wells
for total thiol determination before fluorescence intensity determination.
Wells for protein thiols and nonprotein thiols were first treated
with the cell lysis solution. The lysis solution has been demonstrated
to effectively separate protein thiols and nonprotein thiols in attached
cells by extracting nonprotein thiols into the supernatant.18 The supernatant of the bottom four rows was
transferred to a different 96-well plate and treated with the GUALY’s
reagent derivatizing solution for nonprotein thiols determination.
The remaining protein precipitates in the bottom four rows were thoroughly
washed to remove nonprotein thiols followed by addition of the GUALY’s
reagent derivatizing solution before protein thiols were determined.
Because it has been demonstrated that the sensitivity of the GUALY’s
reagent to different thiols is different,22 absolute quantification of thiols would not be possible. The data
presented in Table 2 are expressed as the percentage
of a control in which cells were treated with no NEM. As shown in
Table 2, the high-throughput assay effectively
reflected different extents of depletion on protein thiols, nonprotein
thiols, and total thiols produced by different concentrations of NEM.
The data in Table 2 demonstrated that nonprotein
thiols were more sensitive to depletion by NEM; all nonprotein thiols
were effectively depleted by 30 μM NEM, whereas 500 μM
NEM was needed to completely deplete protein thiols (Table 2). Table 2 also demonstrates
a close match of the observed total thiols against the calculated
total thiols which was calculated based on the equation (A% + B%)/2 (A: observed protein thiols; B: observed
nonprotein thiols).

Validation of the High-Throughput Assay
A reported
HPLC method for protein thiols, nonprotein thiols, and total thiols
was employed to validate the high-throughput assay.9 Since more cells are needed with the HPLC method, 1.5 ×
106 cells in 10 mL RPMI growth medium without FBS in a
15 mL cell culture tube were used. Removal of FBS in the growth medium
prevented cells from attachment. Cells were first treated with various
concentrations of NEM for 3 h. The cells were then divided into two
parts: 0.6 mL (0.1 mL/well for 6 wells with three wells for total
thiol determination and three wells for protein thiol determination)
was used for the high-throughput assay as described above, while the
rest (9.4 mL) was used for HPLC thiol analysis as described by Chen
and co-workers.9 The initial plan was to
validate protein thiols, nonprotein thiols, and total thiols using
the same sample. However, the NEM concentrations appropriate to provide
a gradient depletion of protein thiols and total thiols were found
to be too high for depleting nonprotein thiols. Therefore, nonprotein
thiol validation was conducted separately using the same procedure
as that for protein thiol and total thiol validation except lower
NEM concentrations were used. Table 3 presents
a comparison of the data of protein thiols and total thiols obtained
through the high-throughput assay versus the data obtained from the
HPLC method. A comparison of the data for nonprotein thiols obtained
from the high-throughput assay versus the data obtained from the HPLC
method is presented in Table 4. As shown in
these two tables, the data obtained through the high-throughput assay
matched closely with the data obtained through the HPLC method confirming
that the high-throughput assay is a valid method for protein thiol,
nonprotein thiol, and total thiol determination. The validation also
confirmed that GUALY’s reagent derivetized all thiols including
“buried” thiols in proteins because the HPLC method
has been demonstrated to be able to quantify all thiols including
“buried” thiols in proteins.9

from one representative experiment of a triplicate.

It is noted that the extent of thiol
depletion by NEM presented
in Table 2 differs from that presented in Tables 3 and 4 (e.g., in Table 2, the percentages of control for the observed nonprotein
thiols, protein thiols, and total thiols were 80% ± 8%, 88% ±
5%, and 81% ± 7%, respectively, while in Tables 3 and 4, the observed nonprotein thiols,
protein thiols, and total thiols were 30% ± 7%, 89% ± 3%,
and 63% ± 3%) despite the same concentration of NEM (10 μM)
being used. The difference is likely due to the fact that the data
presented in Table 2 was a result of NEM depletion
in 15 000 attached cells in a well of a 96-well plate while
the data presented in Tables 3 and 4 were the results derived from NEM depletion in
1.5 × 106 cells in 10 mL as a suspension in a 15 mL
cell culture tube.

Effects of Metal Ions
Because thiols
exhibit excellent
affinity for metal ions, the effects of metal ions that are present
in the biological system on the assay were investigated. GSH was chosen
as a representative thiol. As presented in Table 5, the fluorescence intensity of the thiol adduct formed from
GSH and GUALY’s reagent remained unchanged in the presence
or absence of the metal ions revealing that these metal ions did not
interfere with the assay under the experimental condition. The metal
ion concentrations chosen for the experiment are reported concentrations
of these ions in blood plasma.24−26

In summary, we have developed the
first high-throughput assay for
simultaneous monitoring of protein thiols, nonprotein thiols, and
total thiols in cells with a 96-well plate. The method is rapid, sensitive,
and reliable, and can detect thiols with cell concentrations as low
as 500 cells/well. We also demonstrated that this method can readily
monitor cellular thiol concentration changes. Although the method
cannot provide an absolute quantification for thiols because the fluorescence
intensity of different thiol adducts varies, it provides an accurate
measurement of relative quantification, a parameter often measured
in thiol-related research. In addition to relative quantification
of thiols, this method can potentially be used to quantify disulfides
upon reduction to thiols by a reducing agent such as NaBH4.9 The method will be a valuable tool
in thiol-related research.
