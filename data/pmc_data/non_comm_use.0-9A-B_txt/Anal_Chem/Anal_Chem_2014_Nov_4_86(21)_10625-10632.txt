We
describe a microfluidic Western blot assay (μWestern)
using a Tris tricine discontinuous buffer system suitable for analyses
of a wide molecular mass range (6.5–116 kDa). The Tris tricine
μWestern is completed in an enclosed, straight glass microfluidic
channel housing a photopatterned polyacrylamide gel that incorporates
a photoactive benzophenone methacrylamide monomer. Upon brief ultraviolet
(UV) light exposure, the hydrogel toggles from molecular sieving for
size-based separation to a covalent immobilization scaffold for in
situ antibody probing. Electrophoresis controls all assay stages,
affording purely electronic operation with no pumps or valves needed
for fluid control. Electrophoretic introduction of antibody into and
along the molecular sieving gel requires that the probe must traverse
through (i) a discontinuous gel interface central to the transient
isotachophoresis used to achieve high-performance separations and
(ii) the full axial length of the separation gel. In-channel antibody
probing of small molecular mass species is especially challenging,
since the gel must effectively sieve small proteins while permitting
effective probing with large-molecular-mass antibodies. To create
a well-controlled gel interface, we introduce a fabrication method
that relies on a hydrostatic pressure mismatch between the buffer
and polymer precursor solution to eliminate the interfacial pore-size
control issues that arise when a polymerizing polymer abuts a nonpolymerizing
polymer solution. Combined with a new swept antibody probe plug delivery
scheme, the Tris tricine μWestern blot enables 40% higher separation
resolution as compared to a Tris glycine system, destacking of proteins
down to 6.5 kDa, and a 100-fold better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
for small pore gels, expanding the range of applicable biological
targets.

==== Body
Western blotting
comprises an
indispensable analytical tool for both research and clinical laboratories.1−6 In conventional Western blots, slab-gel electrophoresis forms the
basis for protein sizing. Antibody probing is conducted after transfer
of protein bands from the small-pore-size polyacrylamide gel (e.g.,
19 nm to 140 nm pores for 3.5–10.5% total monomer (%T) and
0.5–10% cross-linker (%C) gels)7 to a larger-pore-size polymer membrane (e.g., PVDF or nitrocellulose
with 200–450 nm size pores).8 Proteins
are immobilized on the membrane via hydrophobic interactions.9 Immobilization of protein bands on a large-pore-size
membrane facilitates antibody-based probing of the immobilized species
with large-molecular-mass antibodies.1 In
effect, the design of conventional Western blotting decouples pore-size
demands required for effective molecular sieving during polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (PAGE) from specifications for effective probing.

Microfluidic design affords faster assay times, smaller sample
volumes, and easier integration with automation systems than conventional
slab-gel systems. Building on these advantages, protein separations
from capillaries,10 microfluidic chips,11 and a microarrayer12 have been interfaced to blotting membranes for probing. In another
approach to full integration, a capillary system supports the protein
separation (mass or pI) and subsequent photocapture and immunoprobing
of antigens on the capillary wall.13,14 The commercial
capillary Western blot completes in 3 h. While an advance in integration,
the assay sees low protein immobilization efficiencies (∼0.01%)
and substantial hardware (fluid pumping, high voltage, and robotic
control for multiplexing).13 In an alternate
approach using a planar glass microdevice, protein separation and
probing steps are integrated on chip yielding assay times as fast
as 3 min.15−18 A microchamber patterned with functionalized polymers forms the
basis for assay integration. Nevertheless, the approach requires complex
fabrication protocols that limit throughput and multiplexing capabilities.

Using a planar microfluidic device, our group reported on a single
microchannel Western technique that unifies protein separation and
probing in a single microfluidic channel. The simple single channel
design provides a basis for scaleup and multiplexing. In order to
integrate the assay stages and obtain high immobilization efficiencies,
the μWestern makes dual use of the separation axis: the axis
forms the molecular sieving dimension during PAGE and also forms the
path for antibody probe introduction during probing (i.e., antibody
is introduced through the protein separation gel).

While the
in-channel probing strategy underpins completion of Western
blotting in a single microchannel, the approach poses a particular
challenge for small-molecular-mass species. The gel must both effectively
sieve small proteins during PAGE and also allow large antibodies to
electromigrate through the gel pores during probing. As such, the
standard Tris glycine microchannel Western blot is limited to analyses
of proteins larger than ∼21 kDa,19 as smaller species remain stacked between the leading and terminating
electrolyte in the 7.5%T gel. While the use of a higher %T gel allows
destacking of smaller-molecular-mass species, the small-pore-size
gel traps antibodies at the separation gel interface, thus substantially
reducing immunoprobing signals. To expand the applicability of microfluidic
Western blotting to smaller molecular mass proteins, we describe a
new fabrication technique that reduces confounding interactions of
the gel with large antibody probes, as well as transition to assay
conditions relevant to smaller species.

Materials and Methods
In-Channel
Gel Fabrication
Microchannel designs are
completed in-house, then fabricated using standard wet glass etching
at a glass foundry (Perkin Elmer).20 Separation
channels are 1 cm long, 10 μm deep, and 70 μm wide. Each
well pair is connected by three parallel separation channels for technical
triplicates. Prior to gel fabrication, channel walls are functionalized
with acrylate monomers, as previously described,21 to enable gel cross-linking to the channel walls.

The separation gel precursor solution is composed of acrylamide/bis(acrylamide)
at a ratio of 37.5:1 (Sigma–Aldrich, No. A3699) diluted to
a final %T between 8 and 12, as indicated in the text. To enable protein
photocapture, 1.5 mM N-[3-[(4-benzoylphenyl)formamido]propyl]methacrylamide
(BPMAC, C21H22N2O3, 350.2
g/mol) is added from a stock solution of 100 mM in DMSO. BPMAC is
synthesized in-house.22 The gel precursor
buffer is 500 mM Tris HCl titrated to pH 8.45 for the Tris tricine
discontinuous buffer system and 375 mM Tris HCl titrated to pH 8.8
for the Tris glycine discontinuous buffer system, consistent with
the Tris HCl pH typically used in slab gels for each respective buffer
system.23 These components are degassed
in a sonicator under vacuum for 3 min. After degassing, sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) (0.1% final concentration) and Triton X-100 (0.1%) are
added along with the initiators riboflavin 5′-monophosphate
(0.0006%) (No. F1392, Sigma–Aldrich), TEMED (0.05% vol/vol)
(No. T9281, Sigma–Aldrich), and ammonium persulfate (0.015%)
(No. A3678, Sigma–Aldrich). Gel precursor is applied to one
well, with capillary action wicking the solution into the dry microchannels.
In the original protocol,19 glass chips
are submerged in a Petri dish with gel buffer precursor solution with
SDS (0.1%) and Triton X-100 (0.1%) after gel precursor loading to
prevent flow in the channels and remove gel precursor from the wells.
In the alternate protocol utilized here (unless otherwise noted),
the gel precursor in the well is replaced with buffer solution after
gel loading but before submerging the chip, so as to generate a buffer/gel
precursor interface partway through the channel (detailed in the Results and Discussion section). For the comparison
of antibody plug to antibody front probe approaches, additional buffer
is added to the opposite well to subsequently migrate the gel precursor
back toward the center of the channel and establish a buffer/gel precursor
interface on both ends of the gel in the channel. While submerged,
chips are photopolymerized using a collimated blue LED source (470
nM, No. M470L2, Thorlabs) at 300 lm (Sper Scientific 840022 Advanced
Light Meter) for 6 min. After fabrication, the chip is stored in gel
buffer solution with 0.1% SDS and 0.1% Triton X-100 until use. In
the case of the DHEBA gel, the acrylamide/bis(acrylamide) solution
is replaced with acrylamide monomer and an N,N′-(1,2-dihydroxyethylene)bis(acrylamide) (DHEBA)
cross-linker (No. 294381, Sigma–Aldrich) at a molar ratio equivalent
to the 37.5:1 bis/acrylamide for a final concentration of 12%T, 3.5%C
acrylamide/DHEBA.

Sample and Antibody Preparation
A protein ladder is
used to optimize the assay, with the ladder consisting of Alexa Fluor
488 conjugated proteins: β-galactosidase (116 kDa) (No. G8511,
Sigma–Aldrich) (labeled in-house), bovine serum albumin (BSA)
(66 kDa) (No. A13100, Life Technologies, prelabeled), ovalbumin (OVA)
(45 kDa) (No. 34781, Life Technologies, prelabeled), c-reactive protein
(CRP) (25 kDa) (labeled in-house), and aprotinin (AP) (6.5 kDa) (No.
sc-3595, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (labeled in-house). Proteins are
labeled using an Alexa Fluor 488 Protein Labeling Kit (No. A10235,
Life Technologies), following the package protocol.

Prior to
Western blotting, the sample is prepared in a buffer consisting of
2% SDS and 100 mM of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) then
heated for 3 min at 90 °C. Finally, 500 mM Tris HCl pH 6.8 is
added to bring the sample to 50 mM Tris HCl pH 6.8 prior to analysis.
Target sample consists of purified prostate specific antigen (PSA)
(No. 539834, Calbiochem) at either 300 nM or 600 nM concentration,
as indicated in the text, and probed using a polyclonal PSA antibody
(No. AF1344, Fisher Scientific). Antibodies are labeled using Alexa
Fluor 568 (No. A10238, Life Technologies), following the package protocol.

Sample Separation
Voltage is applied to the chip using
platinum electrodes attached to a custom-built, eight-channel high-voltage
power supply with current/voltage feedback control. To load sample
onto the chip, 2.3 μL of sample is pipetted into a well and
electrophoresed into the channel at 1.5 μA (∼11 V) (or
1.0 μA, ∼11 V for Tris glycine) for 80 s. The well is
then washed out with the terminating electrolyte run buffer consisting
of 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 3% DMSO with either 1X Tris glycine
(25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine Bio-Rad 161-0734) or 1X Tris tricine (100
mM Tris, 100 mM tricine, No. T1165, Sigma–Aldrich) and a fixed
current applied across the channel to stack the injected plug via
transient isotachophoresis (ITP) and then size the sample species.
Sizing uses a fixed current of 1.5 μA for Tris tricine and 1.0
μA for Tris glycine systems, both of which result in a voltage
ramp of ∼25–55 V/cm during separation. For Tris glycine
separations, 0.3 μA is applied during stacking (∼4–8
V/cm ramp), followed by 1 μA for separation once the proteins
enter the gel, as this yields slightly improved stacking and separation
performance compared to applying a continuous current of 1 μA.
For the Tris tricine system, a 1.5 μA current is applied during
both the stacking (∼12–25 V/cm ramp) and sizing phases.

Protein Blotting
Protein capture on the photoactive
gel is performed using a Hamamatsu Lightening Cure LC5 UV source through
a light guide, with the gel exposed for 30–45 s at 100% intensity.
After photocapture, unconjugated proteins are electrophoresed out
of the channels by applying a reverse voltage for 10 min at 100 V/cm.
During this step, both wells are filled with Tris tricine SDS buffer.
The Tris tricine SDS buffer is then replaced with Tris glycine buffer
(no SDS) in both wells for an additional 10 min washout at 100 V/cm
in the same direction.

Antibody Probing
Following the second
wash step, electrophoresis
is used to drive probe antibodies (500 nM in Tris glycine (no SDS))
through the protein decorated gel. Two antibody probing schemes are
utilized: a plug of antibody (a “top hat” concentration
distribution) and a front of antibody (a “step function”
concentration distribution). In the antibody plug scheme, the concentration
distribution is defined by first electrophoretically loading an antibody
concentration front into the channel (7 min at 200 V/cm) from one
well. To create the plug, the electric field is set to zero and the
loading well is thoroughly washed with Tris glycine buffer via gentle
aspiration. After the well is devoid of antibodies, the electric field
is reapplied (200 V/cm), defining the back of the antibody plug, which
is then allowed to migrate along the separation axis. In the continual
antibody loading scheme, antibodies are electrophoretically loaded
(200 V/cm) along the separation axis until the axial signal is uniform
(∼54 min). Both wells are then thoroughly washed with Tris
glycine buffer via gentle aspiration and a reverse polarity voltage
is applied to electromigrate unbound antibodies out of the channel.

For both probing schemes, fluorescence images are collected every
2 min using automated time lapse imaging controlled via Metamorph.
Monitoring allows determination of the wash time that yields a maximum
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Imaging and Image Analysis
Chips
are imaged on an inverted
epi-fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX-50) using a 10× objective
(Olympus UPlanFLN, NA 0.3) with CCD camera (CoolSNAP HQ2, Photometrics),
filter cubes (XF102-2 and XF100-3 (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT),
and automated x–y stage.

Background values are calculated by taking the raw image values and
subtracting the autofluorescence signal from regions adjacent to the
channel of interest. Prior to antibody loading, the fluorescence intensity
in the channel is approximately equal to the surrounding glass, so
channel intensity higher than the surrounding glass is likely due
to nonspecific antibody adsorption in the channel. To estimate the
standard deviation of the background signal in the channel, we measure
the signal standard deviation in two 50-pixel (192 μm) regions.
The location of the two regions is more than one peak width away from
the probe signal in both channel directions.

The separation
resolution (SR) is defined as the distance between
peak maxima divided by 4 times the average standard deviation of two
neighboring ladder protein concentration distributions, as per convention.
The concentration distribution metrics are calculated via least-squares
fitting to assumed Gaussian distributions (MATLAB).

Results and Discussion
Conducted
in a single enclosed microchannel, the μWestern
(Figure 1) is a multistage assay comprised
of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), protein blotting via
photocapture, and probing with antibodies. The present study addresses
three central performance considerations necessary to optimize a single-channel
microfluidic Western blotting assay for low-molecular-mass proteins.

First, to expand the molecular mass applicability of in-channel
microfluidic Western blotting to include low-molecular-mass species,
we implement a discontinuous Tris tricine buffer system. Originally
developed by Schägger and Von Jagow,23 the Tris tricine system offers improved destacking of small-molecular-weight
species in a given pore-size PAGE gel, as compared to the Laemmli
Tris glycine system.24 The basis for the
extended molecular mass range of the Tris tricine system stems from
the higher electrophoretic mobility of the tricine terminating electrolyte,
as compared to the lower mobility of the commonly used glycine terminating
electrolyte.

Second, to mitigate the reduced effective PA gel
pore size often
observed at a gel/buffer or gel/gel interface, we introduce a new
gel fabrication method. Importantly, careful control of the interfacial
gel pore size is essential to avoid the accumulation of material (i.e.,
antibody probe or sample) at the interface. We also consider an alternative
hydrophilic cross-linker (DHEBA) that offers flexibility in forming
and cleaving cross-links. To assess the performance across these systems,
we utilize immunoprobing of PSA, a 28 kDa protein,25 which is important to prostate cancer screening diagnostics.

Figure 1 Low-molecular-mass
μWestern. Conducted in an enclosed microchannel
filled with photoactive PA gel, the assay is comprised of three steps:
(1) protein sizing after transient isotachophoresis, (2) immobilization
of proteins on gel via UV photocapture (blotting), and (3) in situ
antibody probing via electrophoresis. Optimization for low-molecular-mass
species focuses on the separation and probing stages (bold labels).
The applied electric potential is indicated by plus (+) and minus
(−) symbols. Arrows indicate the direction of species electromigration
under the conditions used.

Third, to reduce background signal on the gel, unwanted accumulation
of antibody material at the gel interface, and total assay duration
in the antibody probing step, we implement antibody probing, using
a swept antibody plug (along the separation axis), compared to earlier
approaches that relied on continuous introduction of a concentration
front.

Separation Step: ITP for Low-Molecular-Mass Proteins
Prior
to PAGE, transient isotachophoresis affords both sample enrichment
and low injection dispersion.26 A discontinuous
buffer system establishes the ITP protein stack. A discontinuous pore-size
gel (step change from large to small pore-size) transitions the assay
from ITP to PAGE. As the ITP sample stack enters the separation gel,
proteins slow, relative to the terminating electrolyte; thus, proteins
destack and separate in the molecular sieving gel.26 In the separation gel, any proteins small enough to migrate
faster than the terminating electrolyte will remain stacked, which
can prevent effective separation of small-molecular-weight species,
particularly in large-pore-size (low %T) gels.

As demonstrated
by Schägger and Von Jagow,23 a Tris
tricine terminating electrolyte ITP system allows effective destacking
of smaller-molecular-weight proteins in a given pore-size gel. The
isoelectric point of tricine is lower than that of glycine, resulting
in tricine having a higher mobility for a given gel pH. Proteins that
electromigrate faster than the terminating electrolyte will remain
stacked. Consequently, a higher-mobility terminating electrolyte enables
destacking of smaller-molecular-weight species in a gel with a given
pore size. In this system, we seek to optimize PAGE for a protein
ladder spanning a mass range of 6.5–116 kDa. Previous work
with our in-channel μWestern performed well across a 21–116
kDa mass range in a 7.5%T, 2.7%C acrylamide/bis(acrylamide) gel and
utilized the conventional Tris glycine trailing electrolyte.19

We first compare the stacking and separation
performance of the
Tris glycine and Tris tricine discontinuous buffer systems, both with
Tris HCl as leading electrolyte (Figure 2A).
ITP stacking is conducted in an open channel (free solution) region
abutting a 12%T discontinuous gel for PAGE. For the conventional Tris
glycine system, we observe a 440 μm (CV = 1.6%, n = 3) ITP stack (Figure 2B) in free solution
and a 200 μm (CV = 3.4%, n = 3) stack at the
gel interface. The Tris tricine system presents an ITP stack of 70
μm (CV = 9.1%, n = 3) in free solution and
a 50 μm stack at the gel interface (CV = 7.8%, n = 3). For Tris glycine, the injected plug is stacked at a ratio
of 3.6, based on comparison of full width at half-maximum (fwhm) for
the loaded sample plug width to the minimum stacked fwhm (CV = 2.6%, n = 3). In contrast, the Tris tricine system yields a stacking
ratio of 17.8 (CV = 5.6%, n = 3). In the case of
the Tris glycine system, a minimum free solution stack width is achieved
within 35 s in the first 1.1 mm of the channel. With the Tris tricine
system, the free solution stack width continues to decrease as the
sample migrates toward the gel interface. With a gel interface located
4.4 mm from the well inlet, a minimum free solution stack width is
achieved in 100 s and at a location just before entering the gel.

discontinuous buffer systems in a 12%T discontinuous gel; PAGE is
operated under a fixed current of 1.5 μA for Tris tricine and
1 μA for Tris glycine, yielding a voltage ramp of ∼25–55
V/cm during each separation. (B) ITP sample stacking intensity profiles
for protein ladder stack in open-channel regions for both the Tris
glycine (upper) and Tris tricine (lower) systems at an initial sample
loading and minimum sample width. During stacking, a 1.5 μA
fixed current is applied for Tris tricine (∼12–25 V
ramp) and a 0.3 μA fixed current (∼4–8 V ramp)
for Tris glycine (as lower current yielded better stacking). Inset
shows ITP stacking in a 4%T stacking gel for the Tris glycine system,
added to reduce putative EOF-induced dispersion. (C) Inverted fluorescence
micrographs and corresponding intensity profiles of sizing in the
Tris glycine (top, open-channel loading, no 4%T gel) and Tris tricine
(bottom) systems. In both cases, the 25 kDa ladder protein is observed
at the 1.5 mm separation distance position.

We hypothesize that the larger stack width observed in the
Tris
glycine system may be due to the greater difference in conductivity
between Tris glycine and the leading electrolyte, Tris HCl, as compared
to the Tris tricine system. The buffer conductivities are measured
as 1.3 mS/cm for the Tris tricine run buffer, 0.47 mS/cm for the Tris
glycine run buffer, 5.1 mS/cm for the 500 mM Tris HCl pH 8.45 gel
buffer in the Tris tricine system, and 3.1 mS/cm for the 375 mM Tris
HCl pH 8.8 gel buffer in the Tris glycine system. We hypothesize that
the enhanced conductivity difference measured for the Tris glycine
system, as compared to the Tris tricine system, may result in a substantial
mismatch in electro-osmotic flow (EOF) between the leading and terminating
electrolyte. Consequently, EOF generated in the open-channel region
during ITP may be contributing dispersion to the Tris glycine system.27

To test the EOF dispersion hypothesis,
we replace the open channel
region with a 4%T stacking gel. The presence of even a large pore-size
gel should reduce EOF and any associated dispersion. In the modified
Tris glycine system (Figure 2B), we observe
an ITP stack width of 31 μm (CV = 13.1%, n =
3). The ratio of the change in fwhm (from injected sample plug to
the stacked plug) for OVA and CRP (BSA destacks in stacking gel) is
23.2 (CV = 9.7%, n = 3) with Tris glycine and 4%T
loading gel, notably higher than the factor of 5.2 stacking previously
observed with the Tris glycine and no loading gel (i.e., free solution)
system for the same proteins. The Tris glycine system with stacking
gel offers stacking similar to that observed in the Tris tricine system
(factor of 27.9 stacking for BSA, OVA, CRP) in free solution. These
observations suggest that EOF-induced dispersion in the open channel/PA
gel Tris glycine system may reduce the ITP stacking capability.

Separation Step: PAGE for Low-Molecular-Mass Proteins
We
next compare the PAGE performance of the Tris tricine to the conventional
Tris glycine system (Figure 2C). We first observe
a total separation time of 153 s for Tris tricine and 143 s for Tris
glycine. PAGE assay completion is defined as the time from when the
sample first enters the separation gel to the arrival of the 25 kDa
ladder protein at the 1.5 mm position on the separation axis. Second,
the SNR for the Tris glycine system is notably lower than that of
the Tris tricine system, as expected given the transient ITP behaviors
described in the previous section. We attribute the slightly lower
protein peak area under the curves (AUCs) for the Tris glycine system
(as compared to the Tris tricine system) to ∼25% less sample
material loaded in the Tris glycine system.

Lastly, the Tris
tricine system is observed to provide ∼40% more SR than the
Tris glycine system, under otherwise similar conditions. The SR between
the two lowest-molecular-mass species (CRP and AP) is SRCRP–AP = 0.66 (CV = 2.3%, n = 3) for Tris glycine and
SRCRP–AP = 0.91 (CV = 3.0%, n =
3) for Tris tricine. Considering the larger proteins, SRBSA-OVA = 0.78 for Tris glycine (CV = 2.4%, n = 3) and
SRBSA-OVA = 1.04 for Tris tricine (CV = 3.3%, n = 3). Whereas SROVA-CRP = 0.63 (CV =
0.9%, n = 3) for Tris glycine and SROVA-CRP = 1.2 (CV = 3.0%, n = 3) for Tris tricine. In summary,
our observations suggest that both the greater sample preconcentration
and lower injection dispersion attained with the Tris tricine system
affords higher PAGE separation performance for the molecular mass
range considered here.

Blotting: Protein Immobilization Efficiency
In lieu
of physical sample transfer from a gel to a hydrophobic blotting membrane,
the μWestern uses UV photocapture of proteins in the channel
via a benzophenone-functionalized polyacrylamide gel.19 While protein is not physically transferred per
se, mass is indeed immobilized: this is the critical aspect
of the blotting step. For a UV exposure of 45 s in the Tris tricine
system, we observe a BSA capture efficiency (ηBSA) of 65.7% (CV = 8.1%, n = 3). For the Tris glycine
system, we observe ηBSA = 51.6% (CV = 6.8%, n = 3). Capture efficiencies for photoimmobilization in
the Tris tricine system are observed to be species-dependent, as reported
previously:22 ηOVA = 48.9%
(CV = 4.8%, n = 3), ηCRP = 35.3%
(CV = 11.5%, n = 3), and ηAP = 63.0%
(CV = 14.1%, n = 3). Raw data and intensity profiles
used to calculate these values are shown in Figure
S-1 in the Supporting Information.

Antibody Probing: Discontinuous
Gel Interface
As the
μWestern is completed in a single enclosed microchannel, introduction
of probing antibodies makes use of directed electromigration of antibody
down the separation axis. An implication of this scheme is that the
large probe antibody electromigrates through the molecular sieving
gel (which, here, has been optimized for a wide molecular mass range
separation that, importantly, includes low-molecular-mass species).
To evaluate the impact of probe introduction into the 12%T sieving
gel after sizing, we utilize a fluorescently labeled polyclonal antibody
against prostate specific antigen (PSA) (see Figure 3A). A plug of antibody is loaded into the channel for 7 min
and then electromigrated along the separation axis (both at 200 V/cm).

Figure 3 A larger
pore-size gradient at the open-channel/gel interface reduces
unwanted size-exclusion effects during probing. (A) Inverted fluorescence
micrographs show antibody probing across a gel with smaller pore sizes
at the interface19 (left) and for a gel
with a gradient to larger pore sizes at the interface (right), both
with 12%T gels utilizing DHEBA cross-linker and 600 nM purified PSA
sample. Gel interface is marked with black arrow; expected location
of the PSA major isoform is indicated with an asterisk (*). (B) Inverted
fluorescence kymographs of a 116–6.5 kDa ladder separation
in an 8%T (top) and 12%T gel (bottom) with a Tris tricine discontinuous
buffer. Right panel shows the ladder when the 25 kDa marker is 1.5
mm into the gel. In the 8%T gel, the small 6.5 kDa marker migrates
faster than the stack and so rejoins the stack a short distance into
the gel. 12%T enables destacking and separation of full 116–6.5
kDa ladder. (C) Schematic depicting fabrication protocol yielding
a short larger-than-bulk to bulk pore-size gradient at the separation
gel interface.

Using this directed electromigration
of probe to immobilized antigen,
we observe interfering antibody accumulation near the open-channel/12%T
gel interface, when using the original fabrication protocol.19 The background signal near the gel/free solution
interface is higher than the probe signal at the immobilized PSA,
resulting in an SNR of <3, even with a sample containing 600 nM
of PSA. High antibody background at the interface occurs regardless
of directionality of antibody loading relative to the interface. In
contrast, a fabrication method enabling the generation of larger pore
sizes at the interface relative to the bulk of the gel generates a
clear antiPSA probe signal for the 28 kDa primary isoform. We also
observe additional minor peaks at a lower and higher MW. We attribute
the smaller MW peak to known biological cleavage PSA isoforms28−31 and/or sample degradation and the larger MW peak to proPSA28−30 and/or PSA aggregates (Figure 3A). Validation
of the μWestern was completed via conventional Western blot.
We observed signal at both larger and smaller MW positions, relative
to the 28 kDa PSA peak position (see Figure S-2
in the Supporting Information), consistent with the μWestern
blot results for the same sample. The lower-molecular-mass PSA cleavage
isoforms present as a single peak in the μWestern, because of
the short separation distance used compared to conventional slab gel
(2 mm vs 8 cm).

The preferential accumulation of antibody probe
material at the
open-channel/gel interface is attributed primarily to size exclusion
at the interface. The size exclusion is exacerbated by the difficulty
in controlling the pore size of the gel at an open channel interface.32,33 Briefly, monomer and cross-linker from unpolymerized regions of
the microfluidic channel diffuse into the polymerizing region during
fabrication, thus establishing smaller pore sizes at the gel/free
solution interface, relative to the pore size in the bulk of the gel.32,33 The small pore size occurs when either photomasking or oxygen inhibition
from the wells is used to create the gel interface. Effective preconcentration
and separation requires a region of free solution (or much larger
pore sizes) adjacent to a separation gel to enable good sample stacking
and destacking. The smaller effective pore size at the open-channel/gel
interface presents an issue for probing, particularly for higher %T
gels, because it is this accumulation of high antibody background
at the interface that obscures the probe signal from the antigen,
greatly reducing assay sensitivity. Simply utilizing a lower %T gel
does not allow for destacking of smaller-molecular-weight species,
thus limiting the assay to larger proteins. As shown in Figure 3B, an 8%T gel results in ineffective destacking
of the small molecular mass protein aprotinin (7 kDa with label),
with aprotinin migrating faster than the stack, thus rejoining the
stack a short distance into the gel. The lower %T gel also results
in lower SR between the other destacked ladder proteins at a given
distance into the gel.

To overcome antibody probe size exclusion
at the open-channel/gel
interface and enable immunoprobing even in high %T gels, we seek to
eliminate the interfacial small pore-size artifact by establishing
a short gradient of larger-than-bulk to bulk pore-sizes at the interface.
We hypothesized that eliminating the unpolymerized gel precursor abutting
the polymerizing region would inherently eliminate the source of additional
monomer and cross-linker that yield smaller pore sizes at the interface
than the bulk of the gel. To achieve the configuration prior to blue
light photopolymerization, the channel is first filled with gel precursor
solution from a well (Figure 3C). Next, gel
precursor solution is removed from the well, thus leaving two empty
wells and a channel filled with gel precursor solution. One well is
then filled with buffer solution (3 μL). Because of the hydrostatic
pressure mismatch generated between the wells, the buffer then flows
into the channel. After a fixed duration (ca. 15 s), the entire chip
is submerged in buffer, thus eliminating the hydrostatic pressure
head and the resultant flow in the channel. The entire chip is illuminated
with a blue LED for 6 min to photopolymerize the gel. The duration
between buffer loading into the well and subsequent submersion of
the chip in buffer establishes the location of the interface gradient
in the channel. The time interval between establishing multifluid
configuration in the channel and photopolymerization establishes the
pore-size gradient characteristics (i.e., pore-size gradient length
and steepness), because of diffusion of the gel precursor into the
free solution region. Longer durations between chip submersion and
photopolymerization would lead to a longer region of the larger pore
size gradient at the interface. For the examples here, the chip is
illuminated with blue light immediately (<1 min) after submerging
to minimize diffusion and generate a relatively sharp interface. As
shown in Figure 2, this fabrication method
enables excellent stacking and separation performance when using the
Tris tricine discontinuous buffer system.

Using the fabrication
technique, we observe an interface located
∼4.4 mm from the edge of the input well for an equilibration
time of 15 s (i.e., duration between buffer loading into the well
and subsequent submersion of the chip in buffer). Variation in the
position of the gel interface between triplicate channels sharing
a well is 1.1% (n = 4 triplicates) and the CV of
the gel interface position between lanes not sharing a well on a chip
is 4.8% (n = 4 triplicates). By observing the location
of the buffer with a fluorescent dye tracer included, the position
of the fluid/fluid interface within the channel is observed to be
linearly dependent on time (R2 = 0.999).
The fluid interface migrates at the same velocity (<1% difference),
regardless of whether the well is filled with buffer or gel precursor,
indicating that the position is dictated by hydraulic pressure alone
and differences in viscosity and surface tension are negligible between
the buffer and the gel precursor. Furthermore, we note that fabrication
of a stacking gel by one-step UV exposure is also possible using this
approach, simply by loading a 4%T, 2.7%C gel precursor solution into
the well instead of buffer solution.

This fabrication method
yields the antibody probe performance shown
on the right-hand side of Figure 3A, which
provides a clear antiPSA probe signal for the PSA isoforms. For both
Figure 3A results, the use of a DHEBA cross-linker,
in place of bis(acrylamide), is utilized as a proof of concept. DHEBA
is a more hydrophilic cross-linker that is cleavable in highly acidic
or basic conditions.34,35 Further development with DHEBA
may enable greater design flexibility in the μWestern blot system
by allowing for an increase in pore size between the separation and
probe stages of the assay.

Antibody Probing: Swept Plug Scheme
Our broad molecular
mass range μWestern19 utilizes electromigration
to drive a front of primary antibodies into and then along the entire
separation axis to achieve probing. In practice, this front introduction
method is applied for 20 min to fill the channel with antibodies,
followed by a 20 min antibody washout in the reverse direction in
a 7.5%T, 2.7%C gel. We seek to establish and validate an alternative
transport approach for probing to (i) reduce assay time and complexity,
(ii) provide uniform antibody incubation times across a gel, (iii)
enable a consistent protocol regardless of gel length or pore size,
and (iv) reduce nonspecific antibody background in the gel, which
increases substantially with increasing %T gels, when using an antibody
front probe approach.19 To achieve these
goals, we investigate electrophoretic introduction of a well-defined
plug of 500 nM antibody into the gel, then along the entire separation
axis (7 min, E = 200 V/cm) (see Figure 4A).

Figure 4 Antibody probing scheme impacts background signal. (A) Inverted
fluorescence micrographs for electrophoresis of antibody probe via
swept plug introduction (top) and continuous front loading (bottom).
Loading images use an exposure time of 50 ms; washout images use an
exposure time of 300 ms. The antibody loading concentration is 500
nM; E = 200 V/cm. (B) Inverted fluorescence micrograph
showing the protein ladder and final probe results for PSA for each
method. The PSA primary isoform is indicated with an asterisk (*).

Selection of the 7 min antibody
loading time for the plug scheme
is informed by results of a kinetic model, indicating that >94%
of
immobilized antigen would be bound assuming kon = 2 × 104 M–1 s–1 and koff = 5 × 10–4 s–1 for an antiPSA mAb.36 For the configuration under study, the antibody plug requires ∼22
min to traverse a 4.5 mm long 12%T, 2.7%C gel with (E = 200 V/cm). We observe maximum SNR after an additional 50 min of
antibody washout via electrophoresis of clear buffer into the channel
(E =200 V/cm).

During antibody probing, we
observed both the major antibody probe
peak and two low-concentration, large-molecular-mass peaks electromigrating
along the microchannel axis. Since the low-concentration peaks continually
migrate during the time lapse imaging, we hypothesize that the peaks
are contamination in the stock antibody probe solution (e.g., aggregation37). As the spurious peaks are continuously mobile,
whereas the probe antibody is immobile at the target peak location,
mobility is used to differentiate the signal sources. We suggest a
filtration step to remove aggregates from the stock antibody solution,
which would reduce assay time by minimizing the probe washout duration.

With a sweep of antibody plug along the separation axis, we observe
an SNR = 263 (CV = 11.4%, n = 3) and average background
intensity in the gel of 24 RFU (CV = 3.2%, n = 3).
In comparison, continual antibody loading yields an SNR of 131 (CV
= 18.8%, n = 3) and a more than 2-fold higher average
antibody background intensity in the gel of 54 RFU (CV = 16.3%, n = 3) for the same sample, which contains 300 nM of PSA
(Figure 4B). Thus, the swept antibody plug
technique results in higher SNR due to a lower background and lower
standard deviation of the background, compared to continually loading
antibodies into the gel.

We further note that the swept antibody
plug scheme offers uniformity
in antibody incubation time with target for all targets, regardless
of molecular mass. In other words and in contrast to a continuous
antibody front introduction approach, high-molecular-mass proteins
immobilized near the head of the separation channel will be incubated
with the antibody probe for the same duration as small proteins immobilized
near the end of the separation axis. Varying the loading time of the
swept plug would allow optimization for different antibody–antigen
binding kinetics by increasing or decreasing the incubation time.

The μWestern channel design also supports optimization to
meet a desired separation resolution and/or a desired assay time.
For example, using a longer separation length would enable improved
separation resolution, with the tradeoff of a longer assay time, since
the antibodies must traverse the full separation length for probing.
Conversely, using a gel length even shorter than the 5-mm gel presented
here would reduce the total assay time.

Conclusions
To
advance μWestern blotting to detection of low molecular
mass species, we report on optimization of the assay by: (i) Tris
tricine discontinuous buffer, (ii) fabrication to generate larger
interfacial pores, and (iii) antibody plug probe. The Tris tricine
discontinuous buffer system enables improved separation resolution
and the destacking of smaller-molecular-weight species for a given
pore size gel. Control over gel interfacial pore size through fabrication
optimization is critical for enabling both good stacking for high
separation resolution as well as good antibody transport for high
SNR probing. Furthermore, utilization of an antibody plug sweep probe
approach reduces antibody consumption while improving assay time and
SNR. Through continued future development with more hydrophilic and
cleavable cross-linkers such as DHEBA, with the effective separation
and probing initially demonstrated here, we plan to further push the
bounds of sample molecular weight, sensitivity, and assay speed. The
approaches presented here expand the applicability of the μWestern
to a wider variety of diagnostic and basic biological research applications.
