We
report on a quantitative study of small molecule binding kinetics
on protein microarrays with plasmonic-based electrochemical impedance
microscopy (P-EIM). P-EIM measures electrical impedance optically
with high spatial resolution by converting a surface charge change
to a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) image intensity change, and the
signal is not scaled to the mass of the analyte. Using P-EIM, we measured
binding kinetics and affinity between small molecule drugs (imatinib
and SB202190) and their target proteins (kinases Abl1 and p38-α).
The measured affinity values are consistent with reported values measured
by an indirect competitive binding assay. We also found that SB202190
has weak bindings to ABL1 with KD >
10
μM, which is not reported in the literature. Furthermore, we
found that P-EIM is less prone to nonspecific binding, a long-standing
issue in SPR. Our results show that P-EIM is a novel method for high-throughput
measurement of small molecule binding kinetics and affinity, which
is critical to the understanding of small molecules in biological
systems and discovery of small molecule drugs.

==== Body
Proteins act by interacting
with other proteins and biomolecules. Important biological processes,
such as communications between cells, expression of genes, and immune
response, rely on specific interactions between proteins and other
molecules, including small molecules. Studying protein interactions
is critical to the discovery of biomarkers for disease diagnosis,
and drugs for disease treatment. Protein interactions are quantified
by binding kinetic constants and affinities, and determining these
parameters is thus a basic task in studying and quantifying protein
interactions.

Current methods for measuring protein interactions
fall into two
categories: label- and label-free-based methods. Label-based methods,
such as fluorescence detection, are mostly end-point assays that do
not provide kinetics information. Furthermore, the use of dye molecules
in fluorescence detection can significantly alter the native properties
of proteins, leading to inaccurate conclusions.1 Label-free methods, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR),2−8 can provide kinetics information, but they often suffer from interference
caused by nonspecific bindings and bulk index changes.9 In addition, the SPR signal is proportional to the mass
of the molecule, so its sensitivity diminishes with the size of the
molecule, making it extremely challenging to detect small molecules.10 Furthermore, reported label-free measurements
of small molecule interaction kinetics either are in low-throughput,
nonmicroarray format9,11−15 or indirectly measure the protein binding signal
instead of the small molecules.16 Small
molecules are the most popular form of drugs,17 and play important roles in many biological processes.18 Therefore, a method to detect and quantify protein
interactions with small molecules in a high-throughput format will
have high impact on both basic research and drug discovery.

We have recently developed plasmonic-based electrochemical impedance
microscopy (P-EIM) that can image local electrochemical impedance
in real time optically with submicron spatial resolution.19−21 P-EIM simultaneously measures both SPR2−5 and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS)22,23 and thus benefits from the capabilities
of both techniques. Compared to traditional EIS that is based on electrical
measurement, P-EIM provides imaging capability with high spatial resolution
and enables high-throughput detection of microarrays. In the present
work, we demonstrate P-EIM measurement of the kinetics and affinity
of small molecule binding to proteins in a microarray format.

The principle of P-EIM is based on the fact that plasmon excitation
at the surface of a metal film is sensitive to the surface charge
of the film. When an oscillating (AC) potential is applied to the
film, the SPR image intensity oscillates with the potential (Figure 1). The local image intensity is separated into DC
and AC components. The former gives the conventional SPR image, and
the latter provides impedance or admittance (inverse of impedance)
images. Compared to SPR, the impedance signal measured by P-EIM scales
with the area, rather than the mass of adsorbed molecules, which is
suitable for detecting small molecules.24−26 Another important advantage
of P-EIM, as shown in the present work, is that the impedance signal
is insensitive to nonspecific binding and solution bulk index changes.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic
illustration of P-EIM experimental setup. An AC potential
modulation is applied to the gold-coated “sensor chip”
(WE) via a potentiostat. A p-polarized collimated point source red
LED light is directed to the sensor chip via a triangle prism at SPR
resonance angle, and the reflected light is recorded via a CCD camera
through a zoom lens. (b) The DC component of the image is the conventional
SPR image, and the AC component is converted to admittance image via
real time data processing. Images show an area on a gold sensor chip
printed with proteins. The image size is 3.63 × 2.27 mm. Note
that the response of each protein spot is calculated by averaging
the intensity over the spot (red circle area) and then subtracting
out the averaged intensity of a local referencing area (area between
blue and red circles).

The present work focuses on the study of a small molecule
inhibitor
binding to a protein kinase, an enzyme that regulates protein activities
via phosphorylation. Because phosphorylation of certain proteins promotes
cancer growth, inhibiting the protein kinases can lead to treatment
of these diseases. Indeed many kinase inhibitors are used as drugs,
but most of them are small molecules, which are difficult to detect.27 One example of the inhibitors studied here is
imatinib (Gleevec), an FDA-approved small molecule drug for treating
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) that inhibits the enzymatic function
of BCR-Abl.28 BCR-Abl is a chimeric protein
formed by the fusion of two independent genes BCR and Abl1, in which
the tyrosine kinase activity of Abl1 is constantly activated. Imatinib
binds to the ATP pocket of Abl1, inhibiting its activity.

Materials and
Methods
Materials
Imatinib and SB202190 were purchased from
BioVision Inc. (Milpitas, CA). Abl, Abl Y253F, p38-α, and myelin
basic protein (MBP) were purchased from Abcam Plc (Cambridge, MA).
Carboxyl-terminated dithiol (COOH) (diSH-PEG-COOH) and hydroxy-terminated
dithiol (OH) (diSH-PEG-OH) were purchased from Nanoscience Instruments,
Inc. (Phoenix, AZ). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO), which were used without further purification. All
buffers were prepared with deionized water.

Sensor Chip Fabrication
The Au sensor chips were BK-7
glass coverslips coated with 2 nm chromium and 47 nm gold by a thermal
evaporator at high vacuum (3 × 10–6 Torr).
Before surface modification, each chip was rinsed with water and ethanol
and then annealed with a hydrogen flame to remove surface contamination.
The cleaned chips were first immersed in ethanol solution containing
10 mM diSH-PEG-COOH and 0.5 mM diSH-PEG-OH overnight and then were
thoroughly washed with water, ethanol, and water again. Next, the
chips were activated with EDC/NHS protocol by coating the whole surface
with a solution of 0.2 M EDC and 0.05 M NHS for 10 min and then rinsed
with deionized water, dried with nitrogen gas, and immediately used
for microarray printing. Protein solutions were deposited on the EDC/NHS-activated
PEG-modified Au chip surfaces with a noncontact piezoelectric inkjet
printer (Engineering Arts LLC) to a uniform pattern of spots with
500 mm spacing. During and after printing, precise dew-point control
was used to mitigate evaporation of the printed protein spots. Relative
humidity (65%) and temperature (24 °C) were precisely regulated
inside the printing chamber. The sensor chips were chilled to 21 °C,
which was a few degrees above the dew-point temperature (17 °C),
to prevent condensation. After printing, the sensor chips were maintained
with dew-point control for 50 min to allow the printed proteins to
covalently bond to the sensor surface. Finally, the printed sensors
were stored under argon gas at 4 °C prior to measurement.

P-EIM
Setup
The P-EIM setup included a SPR imaging
system based on the Kretschmann configuration (Figure 1a) with a temperature-controlled, point source LED (wavelength
670 nm, Hamamatsu) as light source. p-Polarized light from the LED
was collimated and directed to an SF11 equilateral triangle prism
(Edmund Optics) at an incident angle near SPR resonance angle. A CCD
camera (Pike F-032B, Allied Vision Technologies) with a 12× variable
zoom lens (Navitar) was used to record the SPR images. The Au layer
on the sensor chips was used as a working electrode (WE) that was
controlled with a potentiostat (Model Afcbp1, PINE Instrument Co.,
Grove City, PA) using Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode (RE) and a
platinum wire as a counter electrode (CE). For impedance measurement,
the electrode potential was modulated with an amplitude of 250 mV
and a frequency of 10 Hz. The optical system was mounted on an optical
bread board with an active vibration isolation system (Model Vario
Basic 60, Accurion Inc., Linthicum Heights, MD).

Flow System
A multichannel drug perfusion system with
pressure kit (SF-77B, Warner Instruments) was used to deliver sample
solutions to the sensing area as showed in Figure 1a. A terminal pressure of 0.25 psi was used to maintain a
constant flow rate. With the flow system, the transition time between
different solutions was about 1–2 s. A Flexi-Perm silicon chamber
(SASTEDT, www.sarstedt.com) was placed on the top of the
sensor chips to hold the solution and electrodes. A pump was used
to remove the waste liquid from the chamber via plastic tubing.

Small Molecule Sample Preparation
Imatinib and SB202190
were first dissolved in DMSO and then were diluted to working concentration
with running buffer. To avoid any matrix mismatch, the final DMSO
concentration was adjusted to 0.1% (volume) in all samples and running
buffer. In addition, no P-EIM response was observed upon injection
of DMSO (1/500 v/v) onto sensor chips spotted with Abl or any of the
control proteins.

Data Collection and Analysis
The
time stamps of the
CCD camera images and potential modulation signals were collected
by a data acquisition board (NI USB-6251, National Instruments) using
a custom-made Matlab program to synchronize the potential modulation
with response signals. The CCD images were recorded at a speed of
378 frames per second. SPR and impedance signals of each spots were
extracted from the raw images. The averaged signal from a nearby area
of each spot was used to subtract out common noise and system drift
(Figure 1d). Kinetic constants (association ka and dissociation kd) and binding affinities (KD = kd/ka) were calculated
with a 1:1 Langmuir model by fitting the sensor response curves for
each spot with a first-order kinetics.8,29

Radioactive
Kinase Assay
The activity of Abl1 was tested
in a radioactive kinase assay using CRK as substrate. CRK was expressed
in vitro as a flag-tagged protein using Hela lysate IVTT (Thermo Scientific)
and was purified by pulling down through the tag. Abl1 and CRK were
incubated in the same kinase buffer used for the P-EIM assays (2.5
mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.5)) supplemented with
100 μCi/mL 32P-γ-ATP and increasing concentrations
of imatinib (ranging from 0 to 1000 μM). The reaction was performed
at 30 °C for 90 min. After completion of the kinase reaction,
samples were loaded in a SDS-PAGE gel, and the gel was exposed to
X-ray film. The bands were quantified by ImageQuantTL.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 2 SPR (a) and admittance (b) responses to the binding of
imatinib
(0.1, 0.2, 0.5 μM) with Abl1 immobilized on the SPR sensor surface.
The buffer contains 2.5 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM MgCl2 (pH
7.5). Solid lines in panel b are kinetic fitting curves.

SPR versus Impedance Signal
Figure 2 shows the P-EIM (both SPR and impedance) results of imatinib
interaction with printed Abl1 protein. Each plot is averaged SPR or
impedance responses of a printed protein spot upon exposure to imatinib
solution with three different concentrations, extracted from the P-EIM
image sequence. Signals from area surrounding the protein spot were
used as reference to subtract out common noises. As shown in Figure 2a, the SPR signals rapidly increase upon the injection
of imatinib solution, followed by a slow increase phase, with the
maximum increasing value scaled to the concentration of imatinib.
After switching back to running buffer, SPR signals show similar two-phase
responses including a rapid decrease followed by a slow decay. While
the slow phases of the SPR responses reflect the real binding and
dissociation signals, the rapid changes likely do not. The rapid SPR
responses are not due to bulk refraction index changes because the
plots are reference corrected, which subtract out the bulk index change
effect. Therefore, the rapid changes must come from nonspecific absorption
induced by the electrostatic attraction between positively charged
imatinib and negatively charged Abl1 protein. The nonspecific absorption
is weak compared to the specific binding between imatinib and Abl1,
as it rapidly dissociated upon switching back to buffer; however,
it does complicate the measurement of the binding kinetic constants.

In contrast, the simultaneously recorded impedance signals (Figure 2b) do not show any response to the nonspecific absorption.
The injection of imatinib results in a single exponential increase
in admittance, followed by a slow decrease after switching back to
running buffer. The maximum admittance change scales with the concentration
of imatinib. Global fitting of the impedance responses at different
concentrations based on a 1:1 Langmuir model produces kinetic constants: ka = 2.2 × 104 M–1 s–1, kd = 7.4 ×
10–4 s–1, and KD = 2.1 × 10–8 M. While ka and kd are not
available in literature, but KD agrees
with literature reported value of 1.2 × 10–8 M.30,31 These results suggest that impedance can
measure binding kinetics between small molecules and proteins and
is immune to nonspecific adsorption.

To prove the biological
relevance of these findings, the activity
of Abl1 was measured by a radioactive kinase assay under exactly the
same conditions used for the P-EIM experiments. We observed that Abl1
is active and is capable to phosphorylate CRK, a known substrate (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Phosphorylation of CRK by Abl1 in the presence of imatinib.
The
activity of Abl1 in the buffer conditions used for P-EIM experiments
were tested in solution with a radioactive kinase assay. Fixed concentration
of Abl1 and CRK was incubated in the presence of 32P-γ-ATP
and increasing concentrations of imatinib. (A) The X-ray image shows
CRK phosphorylation and (B) the data quantification.

Microarray Detection
To demonstrate
image-based microarray
measurement, and to confirm the specificity of the impedance responses
to imatinib interactions with Abl1, we have measured imatinib interaction
kinetics with sensor chips spotted with different proteins. Figure 4 shows the impedance responses of imatinib interactions
with different proteins, including positive (c-kit and Abl1 Y253F)
and negative (p38-α and MBP) controls for Abl1. C-kit is another
tyrosine kinase that can also be inhibited by imatinib with similar
binding affinity.32 Abl1 Y253F is an Abl1
mutation found in patients that become resistant to imatinib with
a slightly lower binding affinity to imatinib.31 P38-α is a mitogen-activated protein kinase that
does not bind to imatinib.33 Myelin basic
protein (MBP) is a nonkinase protein. Table 1 listed kinetic constants calculated from the impedance response
curve of interaction between 0.2 μM imatinib and these proteins.
The association rate constants (ka), dissociation
rate constants (kd), and binding affinities
(KD = kd/ka) of both positive control proteins are similar
to Abl1, and the binding affinities also match reported values.34−36 Imatinib shows no meaningful binding to MBP and very weak binding
to p38-α, as we expected.

imatinib (0.2 μM)

are reference corrected, as described in Figure 1. Solid lines are kinetic fitting curves. Inset: admittance amplitude

600 s (circled areas).

For cross-validation, we
also measured another small molecule drug,
SB202190, which is an inhibitor for p38-α but not for Abl1.30,31 Interaction kinetics between SB202190 and several proteins are shown
in Figure 5, and the calculated kinetic constants
are shown in Table 2. The binding affinity
between SB202190 and p38-α is 4.3 × 10–8 M, which agrees with the reported value of 10–8 M.30 Interestingly, SB202190 shows weak
bindings with affinity larger than 10–5 M to nontarget
kinases Abl1 and Abl1 Y253F, which were not discovered by the competitive
binding assay.30,31 Because these weak bindings are
transient events, they are not measurable by end-point assays that
rely on the measurement of equilibrium binding state. These results
demonstrate the importance of kinetic measurement, which provides
information on transient molecular interaction that cannot be provided
by other methods. Finally, SB202190 shows negligible interactions
with the negative control MBP. These results show that P-EIM is sensitive
to small molecule-protein interactions and can be used for label-free,
high-throughput measurement of proteins in a microarray format and
can obtain quantitative molecular interaction kinetic information.

Figure 6 Functional study of imatinib/Abl1 interaction: effect
of buffers
and AMPPNP on 0.5 μM imatinib binding kinetics. Working buffer:
2.5 mM Tris buffer pH 7.5 + 1 mM MgCl2; Mg2+ free buffer: 2.5 mM Tris buffer pH 7.5 + 2 mM NaCl. For AMPPNP inhibition
experiment, 100 mM AMPPNP in working buffer was used to preincubate
the sensor chip for 2 h. Solid lines are kinetic fitting curve.

Functional Studies
To further demonstrate P-EIM’s
capability on functional studies of molecular interactions, we studied
Mg2+ dependency and competitive inhibition of imatinib
binding with Abl1. There are controversial reports on the role of
Mg2+ in kinase functionality. Some studies indicate that
Mg2+ binds to the kinase surface and alters the kinase
structure, which favors the binding of kinase inhibitors.37−39 But other studies report that some kinases and inhibitors (including
Abl1/imatinib) show good affinity in buffers without Mg2+ ions.30,31 To verify the effect of Mg2+ on
imatinib/Abl1 interaction kinetics, we have studied the imatinib binding
to Abl1 in buffers with and without Mg2+. The P-EIM impedance
responses (Figure 6) show clearly that the
presence of Mg2+ is critical for imatinib to bind to Abl1,
because imatinib shows little binding in the magnesium-free control
buffer.

Imatinib inhibits the Abl1 phosphorylation function
by competing with the ATP substrate at the ATP binding domain on Abl1.
AMPPNP is an ATP derivative and a competitive inhibitor of most ATP-dependent
systems.33,40,41 We used AMPPNP
to further validate the nature of imatinib interaction with Abl1.
A sensor chip printed with Abl1 was preincubated with 100 μM
AMPPNP prepared in working buffer for 2 h prior to interacting with
imatinib. As shown in Figure 6, the binding
of imatinib to Abl1 was mostly inhibited by AMPPNP incubation (red
triangle curve). The associate rate constants dropped 1 order of magnitude
to ka = 1.1 × 103 M–1 s–1, and the dissociate rate constants
increased 1 order of magnitude to kd =
3.4 × 10–3 s–1; therefore,
the dissociate constants increased 2 orders of magnitude to KD = 3.0 × 10–6 M. This
study further confirmed that the impedance response is specific to
the binding between imatinib and Abl1, and P-EIM can be used for a
real-time functional study of molecular interactions.

Limit of Detection
In the present setup, the measured
detection limit of our P-EIM setup is about 0.1 S/m2 in
terms of admittance (inverse of impedance, at 10 Hz, 0.25 V). Because
the P-EIM signal is not directly related to the target mass, we need
to make some assumptions to get a meaningful comparison with mass-based
methods. The maximum binding signal from the P-EIM response curve
in Figure 2b is about 5 S/m2, which
is 50 times larger than the detection limit. Assume the protein on
the surface has a size of 5 nm and a 50% surface coverage, and the
mass of the small molecule is 500 Da. Then the detection limit in
term of molecular mass is about 0.3 pg/mm2. Another way
to quantify the sensitivity of P-EIM is to compare with the simultaneously
obtained SPRi responses. As shown in Figure 2a, the maximum SPRi signal is about 5 mdeg (excluding the nonspecific
binding signal) and the SPRi sensitivity of the setup is about 1 mdeg,
only a 5-fold difference. Therefore, for imatinib detection, P-EIM
is about 10 times more sensitive than SPRi. Because the P-EIM signal
is not related to the mass of the molecule, for smaller molecules,
P-EIM is more sensitive than SPR. For instance, for a 100 Da molecule,
the equivalent detection limit of P-EIM is 0.06 pg/mm2,
50 times more sensitive than SPRi.

P-EIM Is Immune to Nonspecific
Binding
We have previously
demonstrated that P-EIM is insensitive to bulk refractive index change
and nonspecific absorption of proteins.25 In this paper, we show that P-EIM is also insensitive to nonspecific
absorption of small molecules. To explain the reason, we need to first
understand the nature of the P-EIM impedance signal. The P-EIM signal
is expressed in term of admittance, which measures the conductivity
at the water/gold surface and is proportional to the interfacial capacitance,
which is greatly affected by the molecular layer functionalized on
the sensor surface.25 At molecular scale,
the P-EIM signal arises from two effects, the blocking of electrical
current by the molecular binding events, which normally decrease the
conductivity or admittance, and the oscillation of molecules on the
surface with the potential, which depends on the charge and flexibility
of the molecules.26 Because most proteins
are charged or partially charged, an electrical double layer with
opposite charge will be present near the protein surface. When a periodic
potential is applied to the sensor surface, the proteins on the sensor
surface oscillate with the electrical field, which contributes to
the measured impedance (or admittance).

Most nonspecific binding
is due to weak interactions of the molecule with the surface, which
contributes little to the interfacial capacitance, because the weakly
bound molecules do not significantly block counterions in the solution
or change the proteins immobilized on the surface. In contrast, a
specific binding between a molecule and the proteins can significantly
change the charge and conformation of the protein, leading to a measurable
impedance response. For example, imatinib binds to an inactive conformation
of Abl1 called “DFG-out” and forms an imatinib/Abl1
complex with a distinct conformation from free Abl1, which prevents
the enzyme from switching to the active conformation.42

Conclusion
In summary, P-EIM can
be used to detect small molecules and to
measure the binding kinetics of small molecules with proteins in a
microarray format. With P-EIM, both surface plasmon resonance and
electrical impedance responses can be imaged simultaneously. Unlike
the SPR signal, the impedance response is not scaled with the mass
of analyte molecule and is insensitive to nonspecific bindings caused
by electrostatic interactions. Binding kinetics and affinities between
small molecule inhibitors (imatinib and SB202190) and target protein
kinases (Abl1, p38-α, and others) were obtained. The affinity
results are consistent with reported literature values measured by
an indirect competitive binding assay. In addition, P-EIM revealed
weak interactions between SB202190 and ABL1 with KD > 10 μM, which were not detectable by the indirect
method. This study shows that P-EIM is an important new tool for small
molecule drug discovery, biomarker validation, and disease diagnostics.
