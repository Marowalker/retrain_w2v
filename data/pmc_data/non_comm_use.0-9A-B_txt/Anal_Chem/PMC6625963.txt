combined with mass spectrometry (XL-MS) to derive constraints for protein
three-dimensional structure modeling and to probe protein–protein
interactions has increased during the last years. As the technique is now
becoming routine for in vitro and in vivo applications in proteomics and
structural biology there is a pressing need to define protocols as well as data
analysis and reporting formats. Such consensus formats should become accepted in
the field and be shown to lead to reproducible results. This first,
community-based harmonization study on XL-MS is based on the results of 32
groups participating worldwide. The aim of this paper is to summarize the status
quo of XL-MS and to compare and evaluate existing cross-linking strategies. Our
study therefore builds the framework for establishing best practice guidelines
to conduct cross-linking experiments, perform data analysis, and define
reporting formats with the ultimate goal of assisting scientists to generate
accurate and reproducible XL-MS results.
==== Body
Mass spectrometry (MS) is becoming increasingly popular in the field of
structural biology, with great implications for solving important biological questions.
A central technique in structural MS is chemical cross-linking combined with MS (XL-MS).
Since 2000, XL-MS and computational modeling has advanced from investigating
three-dimensional structures of isolated proteins to deciphering protein interaction
networks.1–4 In the field of integrated structure
analysis, XL-MS is often used in conjunction with cryo-electron microscopy. As the
chemical XL-MS approach allows the capture of transient and weak interactions, it is now
becoming a routine technique for unraveling protein interaction networks in their
natural cellular environment.5 The
knowledge obtained will significantly advance our understanding of the structure of
functional complexes, the topology of cellular networks and molecular details underlying
human pathologies.

Briefly, the XL-MS approach relies on adding a chemical reagent to a protein
solution connecting two functional groups of amino acid side chains. Cross-linker
molecules consist of two reactive groups that are separated via a spacer of defined
length that allow to derive distance information on a protein or a protein assembly. The
cross-linked residues are usually identified after enzymatic digestion of the covalently
connected protein(s) using LC/ESI-MS/MS (liquid chromatography/electrospray
ionization-tandem mass spectrometry) and the resulting fragment ion spectra are
computationally assigned to the cross-linked peptides. The distance constraints imposed
by the chemical cross-linker on the protein’s tertiary structure serve as a basis
for subsequent computational modeling studies to derive three-dimensional structural
models (Scheme S1). XL-MS can
be applied to both proteins and protein complexes and in the case of protein assemblies,
the distance constraints can be used to map the subunit topology. XL-MS is now
increasingly being used for deriving protein–protein interaction maps, both in
vitro and in vivo, where interacting proteins are covalently connected by the
cross-linking reaction.6–13

The wide acceptance of XL-MS by the proteomics and structural biology communities
reflects the increasing importance of cross-linking data for elucidating protein
structures and protein–protein interactions. However, the growth of the user base
brings about challenges of its own: Even a relatively superficial glance at the
literature shows a huge diversity of cross-linkers, experimental workflows, and
computational pipelines. Moreover, the information provided in scientific research
articles that contain cross-linking data can range from being quite detailed to very
brief.

The heterogeneity of cross-linking protocols has mainly emerged from the use of
different cross-linking chemistries and different designs of the corresponding
cross-linker (e.g., noncleavable/cleavable, isotope-coded, or affinity-tagged reagents).
This, in turn, necessitated individual software solutions specifically tailored to the
analysis of data from the experimental workflow. The most common database search engines
used in proteomics are not directly suitable for interpreting mass spectra from
cross-linked peptides. Therefore, the majority of computational solutions have emerged
from laboratories that pioneered the application of XL-MS and created tools specifically
tailored for the analysis of cross-linked peptides. Together with a current lack of
formal or even informal reporting standards, the present state of XL-MS may confuse
researchers that are interested in interpreting results from XL-MS studies or in
adopting the technology. Currently, it is not clear which strategies are most suitable
in general or for a particular application, which makes it challenging to objectively
compare results obtained by different groups.

Certainly, the challenges summarized above resemble those of other disciplines.
In particular, scientists active in “conventional” proteomics research
have tried to address the very same issues over the past decade. Interlaboratory and
software comparison studies have been performed for different experimental strategies,
including data-dependent acquisition,14 selected reaction monitoring,15–18 and most
recently, data-independent acquisition.19,20 In addition, regular
comparative studies have been organized by the Association of Biomolecular Resource
Facilities (ABRF; https://abrf.org/research-group/proteomics-research-group-prg and
https://abrf.org/research-group/proteomics-standards-research-group-sprg).
Together, these studies revealed limitations in commonly used experimental and
computational workflows, but on the other hand also provided evidence for the robustness
of a particular technique when implemented in different laboratories according to
standard operating procedures.

Standardized file formats and reporting guidelines for proteomics have been
developed under the auspices of the Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI) of the Human
Proteome Organization (http://www.psidev.info).21 For example, as far back as 2007, the first recommendations for
minimum reporting standards in proteomics (Minimum Information About a Proteomics
Experiment, MIAPE) have been made,22
which have been followed by detailed guidelines of several proteomics journals. PSI has
also formalized open-file formats, such as the mzML format for raw MS data23 and the mzIdentML format for protein
identifications.24 Such
guidelines and open data formats have also led to an increase in the deposition of
proteomics data in open data repositories such as the PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE)
archive, hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/),25 via the ProteomeXchange initiative (https://www.proteomexchange.org).26

Initiatives for establishing standards and recommendations of best practices
within structural MS techniques, ion mobility-MS (https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Recommendations_for_Reporting_Ion_Mobility_Mass_Spectrometry_Measurements/7072070),
hydrogen/deuterium exchange (manuscripts in preparation), and native MS are or have
recently emerged. Likewise, there is also a clear need for the objective assessment of
the methods and reporting standards within the field of XL-MS. For this purpose, several
researchers active in the field of XL-MS decided to start a community-organized effort
with the goal of providing a first overview of common procedures in XL-MS to generate
the basis for best practices in the field.

In this first interlaboratory effort, 32 groups worldwide contributed,
delivering a total of 58 cross-linking data sets. The data reflect the great diversity
of experimental and computational strategies employed, and to our knowledge, this is the
first comprehensive study with the aim to harmonize the XL-MS field.

Results
Study Design
We opted for a simple study design to encourage participation from as
many laboratories as possible, including those with currently only little
experience in XL-MS. Invitations were sent out to research groups known to be
active in the field from their published work and to attendants of the Symposium
of Structural Proteomics (SSP, http://www.structuralproteomics.net/) meeting series. The
guidelines were kept quite simple, and each participant was provided with a
template spreadsheet to document their method and report their results (Supporting Information).
Bovine serum albumin (BSA), a protein with a molecular weight of ∼66 kDa,
was selected as the study system. We requested that a certain product from a
widely available supplier should be used, and it was specified to use a BSA
concentration of 10 μM. Apart from these restrictions,
we left the contributing laboratories full freedom to choose the experimental
and computational strategies of their choice. This included, among other
parameters, flexibility regarding the choice of cross-linking reagent and its
concentration, buffer composition and pH, reaction time and temperature,
post-cross-linking sample processing (digestion protocol, optional
fractionation, and enrichment of cross-linked products), conditions for LC/MS
analysis, and data analysis procedures (choice of software, search parameters,
validation of the results). In short, we expected that participants would use
the typical XL-MS workflows established in their laboratories. The protocols
used by the individual participating laboratories were collected and analyzed in
the Sinz lab and are summarized in the Supporting Information.

For data analysis, we provided the amino acid sequence of mature BSA
after cleavage of the signal peptide and propeptide sequences (residues
25–607 of the UniProt entry P02769, https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P02769) to ensure a uniform
numbering scheme. Finally, we encouraged participants to perform at least three
replicates. As mentioned above, we provided a template spreadsheet (Supporting Information)
that needed to be completed by the participants before a data set would be
considered for inclusion in the detailed assessment of the results. An overview
of the data sets provided by different laboratories is presented in Figure 1.

Protein System
BSA was selected as model protein for this study as it is a globular and
stable protein that is readily available at low cost. Moreover, the
three-dimensional structure of BSA is well-known, and we selected the Protein
Data Bank entry 4F5S (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4F5S) for further interpretation
of the results. As BSA possesses a tendency toward forming dimers, this has to
be considered when interpreting the results (see also below).

Cross-Linking Reagents
As outlined above, the participants of this study were free to choose
the cross-linking principle(s) on their own (Table S1, Supporting
Information). The majority of groups decided to use noncleavable,
homobifunctional, amine-reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)
cross-linkers, i.e., bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) or
disuccinimidylsuberate (DSS) (Figure 2a).
Both cross-linkers only differ by a sulfonic acid group that is incorporated for
increased water solubility and bridge a distance of 11.4 Å, resulting in
Cα–Cα distances of
∼27 Å to be cross-linked.27 MS-cleavable cross-linkers, such as
disuccinimidylsulfoxide (DSSO) and disuccinimidyldibutyric urea (DSBU), are
increasingly being used as they allow a targeted identification of cross-linked
product based on characteristic reporter ions generated during MS/MS
experiments. MS-cleavability as a cross-linker feature is essential to reduce
the search space in conducting proteome-wide cross-linking studies. The vast
majority of cross-linkers used herein target amine groups in proteins, i.e.,
lysine side chains, while carboxylic acid groups, such as aspartic and glutamic
acid residues, are less frequently targeted (Figure 2b). The main spacer lengths of the cross-linkers are
determined by the three most abundant cross-linkers used in this study,
BS3 and DSS (both 11.4 Å), DSBU (12.5 Å), and DSSO
(10.1 Å) (Figure 2c).

Reaction Conditions
The reaction conditions were also kept completely open to the
participants, including cross-linking reaction time, temperature, cross-linker
excess, and pH value of the cross-linking solution (Figure 3). Not surprisingly, the pH value of the
cross-linking reaction mixture was kept around pH 7.4 to 7.5 in the majority of
experiments in order to resemble the physiological pH situation. A pH value of
8.0 that was also used in some experiments has the advantage of enhancing the
reactivity of NHS esters with nucleophiles. The temperature was kept to 20, 25,
or 37 °C in the majority of experiments, with lower temperature being
applied only by a few groups. For BSA, a temperature of 37 °C certainly
does not present a problem as it is a stable, globular protein, but for delicate
and unstable proteins one should take care to conduct the cross-linking reaction
at lower temperatures.

Instrument Platforms and Settings Used to Generate XL-MS Data
The overwhelming majority of cross-linking data were generated on
orbitrap mass spectrometers (Figure 4).
Only two FTICR (SolariX and Velos FTICR) mass spectrometers and one Q-TOF
(Synapt G2 SI) instrument were employed (Figure
4a). All groups used LC/ESI-MS/MS analysis, applying for most
experiments a resolving power of 60 000 or 120 000 (at
m/z 200 or 400, as specified by the
manufacturer Thermo Fisher Scientific for orbitrap instruments) (Figure 4b). For MS/MS experiments, a
resolving power of 15 000 or 30 000 was employed in most cases (Figure 4c). Details on enrichment of
cross-linked species, considered charge states, fragmentation methods, and
MS3 resolution are presented in the Supporting Information (Figure S1).

Data Analysis and Validation Strategies
Strategies for data analysis were highly diverse (Figure 5), reflecting the variety in the XL-MS field where
nearly every group possesses their own software tools tailored to fit their
specific needs. This enormous variety is currently one of the most critical
issues in XL-MS, and we consider it as an important contribution of this study
to reflect this diversity. The false discovery rate (FDR) plays an important
role in this context, and from this study it arose that most of the groups apply
an FDR of 5% (Figure 5b). Manual validation
of the cross-links was performed for 66% of the experiments, while in 34%, the
data sets were not manually checked. It is important to note that a mechanism to
control the FDR should exist in the software; although proper FDR control is not
trivial for small search spaces, manual validation strategies might be
especially beneficial in such cases. Some strategies provide additional layers
of evidence that can be used to better control the error rate. For example,
isotope-coded, noncleavable linkers provide two independent measures of
precursor and fragment masses and charge state information for fragments
independent of MS resolution; MS-cleavable linkers provide three layers of
information: intact precursors, released fragments corresponding to intact
peptide chains, and fragments thereof. In the absence of such strategies, we
recommend that preferentially both, MS and MS/MS data, should be recorded with
high mass accuracy to rule out a false assignment of cross-linked products.
Clearly, some of these effects will only become apparent for samples of higher
complexity.

Identified Cross-Links
As we left it to the individual participants whether to use in-solution
or in-gel digestion as the workup method before LC/MS/MS analysis, 47 data sets
were generated by in-solution digestion, while 10 samples originated from in-gel
digestion (Figure 1). As already mentioned,
BSA has a tendency to form dimers, which somewhat complicates data analysis. In
case only the BSA monomer band is used for in-gel digestion and subsequent
generation of the cross-linking data set, one can definitely rule out that
cross-links are in fact representing intermolecular interactions between two BSA
molecules. On the other hand, during the in-gel digestion procedure cross-links
might get lost, resulting in an overall lower number of cross-linked
products.

Another aspect regards the reaction sites that were considered during
data analysis. Usually, NHS esters, such as the mainly used cross-linkers
BS3, DSS, DSBU, and DSSO, will react with lysine, but they also
exhibit a significant reactivity toward serine, threonine, and tyrosine. The pH
used for conducting the cross-linking reaction plays a significant role as amine
reactivity is increased at higher pH values. Some participants considered only
Lys–Lys cross-links and neglected the side-reactivity of NHS esters with
hydroxy group-containing amino acids. In this study, it became apparent that
Ser, Thr, and Tyr account for ∼30% of cross-linking sites (Supporting Information, Figure
S2). The reactivity of Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues obviously depends
on the reaction conditions (cross-linker, pH value of the solution) as well as
local pKa value. It is not practicable to consider
Lys, Ser, Thr, and Tyr when analyzing very complex systems, such as complete
proteomes. Therefore, we suggest as a compromise to consider for whole proteome
samples only lysine as the reactive sites of NHS ester cross-linkers, while for
single proteins or proteins assemblies, Lys, Ser, Thr, and Tyr might be taken
into account.

Figure 6 provides an overview about
the reproducibility of results obtained with the individual workflows of the
participants. For in-solution digestion workflows, the average number of unique
cross-links in BSA is 78, while for in-gel digestion workflows using only the
monomeric BSA band, the average number is 44. The term
“cross-link” refers to the specific amino acid residues that are
connected, irrespective of different peptide sequences due to missed cleavage
sites or modifications. The majority of participating laboratories came up with
similar numbers of unique cross-links, independently of the cross-linking
conditions used (Figure 6a). Three
cross-linking workflows however recorded a significantly higher number of
cross-links (between 260 and 350). The reason could be a false consideration of
cross-links from BSA dimers that in some preparations might have been a
dominating species due to inappropriate sample treatment. For in-gel digestion
workflows, up to 19 overlength cross-links were reported in one data set, which
could represent false-positives due to partial unfolding as only the monomeric
form of BSA was considered in these samples (Figure 6b).

A more detailed inspection of the unique cross-links revealed highly
interesting insights: Data sets created from amine-reactive cross-linkers
(BS3, DSBU, DSS, DSSO, DC4, MC4, CBDPS) using an in-solution
digestion workflow yielded a total of 1066 unique cross-links. A complete list
of unique cross-links, identified with cross-linkers reacting with nucleophiles
(amine and hydroxy groups) and sorted by their reproducibility, is provided as
separate file in the Supporting Information. In total, 601 of 1066 unique cross-links
(56%) were however identified in only one single data set (Figure 7). This indicates an overall low reproducibility of
cross-linking results. The curve in Figure
7a shows that the number of unique cross-links identified is
inversely proportional to the reproducibility of cross-links in the data sets
(coefficient of proportionality ≃ –1). If the reproducibility
across the data sets is higher than 20%, the effect of including more data sets,
different reaction conditions, and analytical parameters determines a linear
increment of the number of cross-link identifications. The intercept with the
y-axis of the resulting interpolated linear curves
indicates the putative number of cross-links in BSA to be between 73 and 88
(Figure 7b). This value is very close
to the average number of cross-links found (78 cross-links per data set for
in-solution digestion workflows, Figure
6a). In Figure 7c, the dependence of
the linear correlation on the reproducibility of cross-links identified is
indicated. This indicates that a linear correlation only exists for highly
reproducible cross-links.

Cross-Links Identified from In-Gel Digested BSA Monomer Band
We mapped cross-links in the monomer band of BSA using
in-gel digestion (in total 10 data sets) into the published
3D structure of BSA (PDB entry 4F5S). For this, a statistical analysis could be
performed for homobifunctional, amine-reactive linkers considered only for this
type of cross-linker. Only cross-links identified in at least two independent
experiments are presented (Figure S3). A total of 30 out of 230 cross-links exceeds the maximum
length of 30 Å for the cross-linkers employed in this study. These
overlength cross-links either originate from a false assignment or by applying
nonsuitable experimental conditions. Strikingly, 29 of these overlength
cross-links were identified in one single experiment only. Cross-links that were
identified in at least two independent experiments show one overlength link,
while cross-links found in at least three independent experiments all fall
within the given distance limit of 30 Å (Figure S4). As guideline
for testing cross-linking workflows, we provide a list of cross-links that were
identified in at least two independent experiments from in-gel digestion of the
BSA monomer band (Table S3,
Supporting Information).

Monomer–Dimer Equilibrium of BSA
BSA exists in a monomer–dimer equilibrium, which may give rise to
ambiguities in the identification of intra- and intermolecular cross-links. To
address this issue, we performed additional experiments with four concentrations
of BSA (10, 5, 1, and 0.5 μM). Strikingly, the number of
overlength cross-links was very low (only 1 or 2). Moreover, the numbers of
overlength cross-links were similar for all four BSA concentrations used (Table S4, Supporting
Information). This clearly indicates that a BSA concentration of 10
μM, as chosen for this study, is suitable for
conducting cross-linking MS experiments.

Comparison of Data Acquisition and Analysis Strategies from One Participating
Laboratory
Because most of the data in this study have been generated in different
laboratories, differences in instrumentation and in the software used for data
analysis make a direct comparison of selected results difficult. However, we
used a subset of the data generated in a single laboratory to study the effect
of the type of mass spectrometer and of different search settings on the outcome
for a relatively simple model system, such as BSA (see Supporting
Information).

Discussion
This first community-based cross-linking study reflects the high diversity
of XL-MS workflows that are currently employed in different laboratories worldwide.
However, it also became apparent that independent of the workflow used, the results
obtained are to some degree comparable. For beginners in the field, we suggest to
use BSA as an initial study system and compare the outcome to the results obtained
herein. As a guideline, the number of cross-links expected for BSA should be
∼80 for an in-solution workflow, considering cross-links of the monomer and
the dimer. Not unexpectedly, our study did not reveal the optimum experimental
protocol or software to be used in any and all projects. The applications of XL-MS
are just too diverse so that no single cross-linker, instrument, or software tool is
expected to be preferable for all scenarios, ranging from single protein (as used in
this work) to whole-cell cross-linking. There are also clear interdependencies
between the type of cross-linker (cleavable, noncleavable) and the software that can
be applied to process such data as well as between instrument type and software as
not all fragmentation methods or other MS platform-dependent features may be
supported.

As discussed above, XL-MS has become an essential part of many structural
proteomics studies but is also a key element in integrative structural biology
projects. In such interdisciplinary work, XL data may only be a small “puzzle
piece” that is combined with other experimental data provided by methods such
as electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray
scattering, together with computational modeling. Details about how experiments were
carried out, how the data were processed, and how error rates were assessed are
often missing from the publication, making it difficult for reviewers and readers to
assess the reliability and credibility of the results. We therefore recommend that
appropriate consideration should be given to the method section of all XL-MS
publications by providing all necessary experimental and computational details. Our
reporting template could serve as a starting point for the “minimum
information about a cross-linking experiment” that should be included in
research articles containing XL-MS data. This template is included in the Supporting Information for
all XL-MS data reports. Sufficient information needs to be provided, irrespective of
the relative contribution of the cross-linking experiments to a specific project.
This will also facilitate the cross-referencing of XL-MS data in integrative
structural biology projects, for example, in the dedicated PDB prototype archive,
PDB-Dev.28

Data deposition to a proteomics repository, such as PRIDE, is encouraged, as
the paucity of available data sets do not assist the field in validation, methods
evaluation, and workflow quality. It should be noted that not all data sets assigned
to the cross-linking category in PRIDE originate from genuine XL-MS experiments (in
the sense that cross-linking sites were identified) but also contain data from
experiments that used cross-linking for the stabilization of complexes. The low
uptake of data deposition may in part be due to the specific nature of XL-MS data.
For a “complete” submission to ProteomeX-change, allowing a complete
integration of search results and assignment of a Digital Object Identifier, the
reported results need to be compliant with a PSI format, such as mzIdentML. Although
the most recent version of mzIdentML (version 1.2) includes support for some XL-MS
strategies, such a proteomics-centered format cannot easily consider all possible
workflows, and few dedicated cross-linking search engines offer mzIdentML-compliant
export at this point. Nevertheless, even a “partial” submission will
make the raw MS data and results available in a user-specified format for download
and reuse by interested researchers.

Additional studies that cover a wider range of sample types, such as large
multiprotein assemblies or even whole proteomes, will be required to obtain a better
understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of different experimental workflows.
However, we believe that this first community-based study serves as the starting
point for further initiatives in this direction and encourages the adoption of
consistent reporting and data sharing guidelines in XL-MS. We would like to invite
interested parties to participate in the discussion to expand the growing XL-MS
community.

Conclusion and Guidelines
Although XL-MS is becoming routine for in vitro and in vivo applications in
proteomics and structural biology, this harmonization initiative unveiled a great
variety in the cross-links identified by participating groups, even for the single
protein BSA. This underlines the need for establishing generally accepted XL-MS
protocols as well as data analysis and reporting formats. This interlaboratory study
on XL-MS represents the first effort of the community toward establishing endorsed
and transparent good practice guidelines for performing and reporting XL-MS
experiments. This study also serves as test for all laboratories to evaluate the
quality of their XL-MS workflows and will aid in improving eventual weaknesses. In
summary, seven guidelines were deduced from this study as framework for conducting
XL-MS experiments as detailed in Table 1.

Figure 1 Overview of data sets provided by the participants of this study: 32 groups
participated in this study, yielding 58 separate cross-linking workflows. Nine
data sets had to be excluded due to missing replicates and nonuniform
conditions, resulting in a total of 49 data sets that were further considered.
Several workflows contain both insolution (47 samples) as well as in-gel
digestion (10 samples) as processing methods. The samples were considered only
once during a workflow analysis.

Figure 2 (a) Cross-linking reagents used in this study; noncleavable cross-linkers are
presented in red, MS-cleavable cross-linkers are shown in blue, (b) reactivity,
and (c) spacer length. The cross-linkers used in this study are BS3
(bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate, DSS (disuccinimidylsuberate), DSP
(dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate)), DMTMM
(4-(4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methyl-morpholinium chloride) with and
without PDH (pimelic acid dihydrazide), sulfo-SDA (sulfosuccinimidyl
4,4′-azipentanoate), CBSS (carboxy-benzophenone sulfosuccinimide), DSSO
(disuccinimidylsulfoxide), DSBU (disuccinimidyldibutyric urea), BDP-NHP
(N-hydroxyphthalamide ester of biotin aspartate proline),
CBDPS (cyanurbiotindimercaptopropionyl succinimide), DC4

and MC4
(N,N′-bis(4-((2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl)oxy)-4-oxobutyl)-morpholine).

Figure 3 (a) Time, temperature, and cross-linker excess (XL-fold) were set as variable
parameters, presented as gray spheres. The colored dots are projections of the
3D space onto 2D planes. (b) pH values of the cross-linking reactions ranged
between 7.0 and 8.2.

Figure 4 LC/MS/MS conditions applied. (a) MS instrumentation, (b) MS resolving power, and
(c) MS/MS resolving power. Resolving power is defined at
m/z 200 for orbitrap instruments, while
for ICR instruments it is defined at m/z 400.
Please note that several research groups generated data sets with different
instruments and settings.

Figure 5 (a) Software tools used in this study (a complete summary is found in Table S2, Supporting
Information). Red bars indicate that the software is applicable only
for noncleavable cross-linkers; blue bars indicate that the software can be used
for MS-cleavable cross-linkers. (b) False discovery rates. (c) Mass tolerance

performed using the XlinkX software node.

Figure 6 Number of BSA cross-links identified. The numbers of cross-links are plotted for
(a) in-solution and (b) in-gel digestion workflows. The different cross-linkers
are shown as symbols; abbreviations of the cross-linkers are according to Figure 2. The maximum distances are given for
each cross-linker, indicating the number of overlength cross-links. Every point
is a sum of three replicate measurements; replicates of the entire experiment
are shown in blue, and replicates of the LC/MS analyses are shown in red; the
average number and reproducibility of unique cross-links are shown in
yellow.

Figure 7 Comparison of unique cross-links. “Cross-link” denotes the unique
amino acid residues that are connected by homobifunctional, amine-reactive
cross-linkers. (a) Number of cross-links with respect to their reproducibility
among the data sets. (b) Linear extrapolation of all (red) or a linear subset
(blue) of cross-links resulted in a maximum cross-linking number between 73 and
88. (c) Plot summarizes the intercepts with the y-axis (red)
and the correlation coefficient × 100 (blue) of the respective linear
extrapolations of part a. The linear extrapolation was calculated as shown in
part b by successively removing the data points starting from the lowest
reproducible value.

Table 1 Cross-Linking Mass Spectrometry Guidelines (Guidelines 1 and 2 Are Derived
from the Results Shown in Figure 5)
no.	topic	description	
1	FDR	A mechanism to control the FDR should exist in
the software used for cross-link identification. The FDR algorithm has
to be described in detail. For small search spaces, manual validation
strategies might be beneficial.	
2	mass accuracy	MS and MS/MS data should be recorded and
analyzed with high mass accuracy to reduce false assignments of
cross-linked products, or multiple lines of evidence from isotope
labeling or cleavable linkers should be obtained.	
3	experimental details	Provide all experimental and computational
details. The reporting template (Supporting Information) comprises the
“minimum information of a cross-linking experiment” that
should be included in research articles containing XL-MS data.	
4	data deposition	Deposit raw MS files together with a
description of their content and the reporting template to a proteomics
repository, such as PRIDE.	
5	visualization of cross-linked proteins
cross-linker selectivity	Perform SDS-PAGE analysis to evaluate the
cross-linking performance under the employed experimental conditions.
Check for possible high-molecular weight aggregates.	
6	cross-linker selectivity	Consider only lysine and the N-terminus as
reactive sites of amine-reactive cross-linkers for whole proteome
samples. For single proteins or large protein assemblies, consider
lysine, N-terminus, serine, threonine, and tyrosine as reactive
sites.	
7	BSA cross-links	Approximately 80 cross-links can be expected
for cross-linking of BSA using homobifunctional amine-reactive
cross-linkers and an insolution digestion workflow.
