Annotation
and identification of metabolite biomarkers is critical
for their biological interpretation in metabolic phenotyping studies,
presenting a significant bottleneck in the successful implementation
of untargeted metabolomics. Here, a systematic multistep protocol
was developed for the purification and de novo structural elucidation
of urinary metabolites. The protocol is most suited for instances
where structure elucidation and metabolite annotation are critical
for the downstream biological interpretation of metabolic phenotyping
studies. First, a bulk urine pool was desalted using ion-exchange
resins enabling large-scale fractionation using precise iterations
of analytical scale chromatography. Primary urine fractions were collected
and assembled into a “fraction bank” suitable for long-term
laboratory storage. Secondary and tertiary fractionations exploited
differences in selectivity across a range of reversed-phase chemistries,
achieving the purification of metabolites of interest yielding an
amount of material suitable for chemical characterization. To exemplify
the application of the systematic workflow in a diverse set of cases,
four metabolites with a range of physicochemical properties were selected
and purified from urine and subjected to chemical formula and structure
elucidation by respective magnetic resonance mass spectrometry (MRMS)
and NMR analyses. Their structures were fully assigned as tetrahydropentoxyline,
indole-3-acetic-acid-O-glucuronide, p-cresol glucuronide, and pregnanediol-3-glucuronide. Unused effluent
was collected, dried, and returned to the fraction bank, demonstrating
the viability of the system for repeat use in metabolite annotation
with a high degree of efficiency.

==== Body
Metabolic
profiling of human
biofluids by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS)
is widely used in clinical and epidemiological studies. Improvements
in analytical technologies and automation of data processing have
made it possible to increase both the number and throughput of sample
analysis. In addition, technological advancements allowing greater
analytical sensitivity, precision, and selectivity have led to the
increase of the number of the detectable chemicals providing greater
metabolome coverage. The extensive breadth of metabolic profiling
data ensures that metabolite annotation and identification remain
major bottlenecks in the metabolic phenotyping workflow, with low
abundance metabolites, gut microbial cometabolites, secondary metabolites
(glucuronides and sulfates), and chemically modified drug and diet
related metabolites representing specific challenges. Growth of publicly
available databases containing mass spectral reference data for thousands
of chemical species1−3 is limited by the availability of authentic chemical
standards, and the value of establishing method-specific in-house
databases (e.g., complete with chromatographic retention time measurement)
is further hampered by the lack of consistency in standard chromatographic
profiling methods employed. Some in silico spectra prediction computational
tools and pipelines4,5 are being developed,5−8 as well as retention time prediction,9,10 chemical similarity,11 and biological assumptions to extend the reach
of generic metabolite annotation capabilities beyond the limitations
of reference data. However, to meet the emphasis placed on the biological
interpretation of specific biomarkers arising from profiling studies,
further advancements in de novo structure elucidation are required
to accelerate the identification of unknown metabolic markers of interest,
ultimately mapping the large chemical space of the human metabolome
observable by analytical profiling methods.

The two widely used
analytical platforms that provide information
on molecular structure and elemental composition of unknown chemicals
are nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy12 and mass spectrometry (high-resolution MS and tandem MS/MS).13 The combination of both techniques can provide
detailed chemical formula and structural information leading to comprehensive
annotation. This approach is being widely employed in natural products
chemistry,14,15 as well as in drug discovery,16 and in drug metabolism and metabolite discovery
in the pharmaceutical industry.17 Recently,
multitechnique approaches have been applied to both plant18,19 and bacterial20 metabolomics, while LC-MS
has been used to assist with the structural elucidation of metabolites
from NMR-based experiments.21

Traditionally
in natural products chemistry, to generate the required
concentration of metabolites pure enough to annotate via NMR spectroscopy
preparative-scale liquid chromatography or flash chromatography systems
are employed.22 However, these are often
costly and are not available to analytical laboratories who routinely
perform metabolic profiling studies using UHPLC-MS systems. The subsequent
application of NMR spectroscopy to structurally elucidate features
from LC-MS based metabolite profiling has its own challenges. NMR
spectroscopic analyses do not have the sensitivity of LC-MS assays;
therefore, large quantities (often in the order of milligrams) of
relatively pure material isolated from biofluids, such as blood (serum
and plasma) or urine, are required for structural elucidation.

Of the biofluids commonly studied in human phenotyping experiments,
urine holds an advantage over blood products because of the noninvasive
collection of large volumes (e.g., via routine 24 h collections which
typically produce liters of biofluid per day and per person), making
it an ideal starting material for purification and concentration for
NMR structural elucidation. In addition, urine is a key biological
matrix within metabolic profiling because it contains an extreme diversity
of chemical classes, including gut microbial cometabolites and xenobiotics.23 Moreover, many metabolites present in blood
are excreted and can be detected in urine23, and many metabolites circulating in blood may, therefore, be found
in urine and recovered in larger amounts for further spectroscopic
characterization.

At the same time, the urine matrix also poses
chromatographic challenges
because of its high inorganic salt content. In reversed-phase (RP)
LC-MS analysis and fractionation, the presence of large salt amounts
can cause various problems with both LC system and retention of the
compounds, as well as with their MS detection. The salts from the
urine samples can precipitate in the chromatographic column, and the
amount of precipitate can increase with subsequent injections under
the gradient conditions leading to a faster column degradation. Salts
present in the sample or mobile phase can have also a strong influence
on the solid–liquid equilibria that establish during the chromatographic
run, especially in the case of ionized polar compounds.24 A high salt concentration can also impact the
performance of NMR probes, decreasing the sensitivity and making it
difficult to optimize experimental parameters.

To leverage the
availability of human urine, its potential for
use as a proxy matrix for systemic human and gut microbial metabolism,
and the general availability of analytical scale instrumentation in
metabolic phenotyping laboratories, we designed and implemented a
novel urine-based pipeline solution that facilitates metabolite extraction,
concentration, and purification using analytical scale systems coupled
to a fractionation system. Prior to the primary fractionation, a urine
pool underwent a desalting procedure using ion-exchange resin, which
allowed for high-precision RPLC separation on an analytical scale
system that demonstrated no degradation in column performance.

The resulting workflow enables purification and concentration of
small molecule metabolites from urine that is easily implementable
in analytical laboratories without the need for specialist purification
LC systems. These purified metabolites can be subsequently decoupled
from the pipeline and studied by a range of highly structural informative
analytical techniques, such as such as Magnetic Resonance Mass Spectrometry
(MRMS) or NMR. The efficacy and systematic deployment of the developed
pipeline is demonstrated using a set of unknown metabolites of various
biochemical classes and different physicochemical properties.

Materials
and Methods
In-House MRC-NIHR National Phenome Centre Reversed-Phase Metabolite
Profiling Method
Pooled bulk urine and all subsequent downstream
fractions underwent RP profiling using the method developed in-house
at the NIHR-MRC National Phenome Centre (NPC) at Imperial College
London described in detail in ref (25).

To briefly summarize, RP urine profiling
was completed using a Waters Acquity UPLC system coupled to a Waters
Xevo G2 QToF mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). LC
separation was conducted on a 2.1 × 150 mm HSS T3 column (Waters
Corp., Milford, MA, USA) maintained at 45 °C. Mobile phase flow
rate was of 0.6 mL/min. A gradient was applied consisting of 0.1%
formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B).
Initial conditions of 99% A were held at isocratic conditions for
0.1 min, followed by a linear gradient elution, 99% A to 45% A, in
9.9 min, and a final rapid gradient phase, 45% A to 0% A in 0.7 min,
prior to returning to initial conditions. Injection volume was 2 μL.

Mass spectrometry optimization is described in detail in ref (25). To briefly summarize,
capillary voltage was set at 1.5 and 1.0 kV for positive and negative
ionization, respectively. Cone voltage (20 V), source offset (80 V),
StepWave 2 offset (10 V), and gas flows of 150 L/h for cone gas and
1000L/h for desolvation gas were consistent for both polarities.

Masslynx software (Waters, Manchester, U.K.) was used for data
acquisition and visual inspection.

Pipeline for Systematic
Biomarker Isolation and De Novo Structure
Elucidation
An overview of the pipeline is presented in Figure 1. First, urine from
6 volunteers was collected and pooled. The urine was split into two
identical subpools. The first underwent desalting using an ion exchange
protocol. The second was kept as a control. Both underwent 10-fold
concentration by drying under a stream of nitrogen (Biotage Turbovap
Classic), followed by primary RPLC fractionation creating both a desalted
and a control fraction bank of 120 fractions. All stages underwent
profiling using LC-MS so that the protocols could be compared. The
desalted fraction bank, which had greater chromatographic reproducibility
and long-term resolution, was utilized for downstream secondary and
tertiary fractionation. The final fractions were then decoupled from
the pipeline and sent to NMR spectroscopy and magnetic resonance mass
spectrometry (MRMS)—traditionally known as Fourier transform
ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR MS), or simply Fourier
transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) for annotation. In some cases,
tertiary fractionation can be replaced with a computational purification
by using statistical heterospectroscopy (SHY)27 in combination with NMR spectroscopy profiling.

Figure 1 Workflow of the pipeline.

Pipeline Phase 1—Bulk
Urine Preparation
Urine Collection
Individual urine
was collected from
a volunteer group of mixed genders (n = 6) and at
multiple collection time points. No screening criteria were used to
assess the health status of the donors. A total of 2 L was collected
and pooled as described in ref (25). This was split into two one-liter identical aliquots.
Pool one was used as an untreated control to assess the effect of
the desalting protocol.

Urine Desalting
Urine pool 2 underwent
a desalting
process developed in-house using a two-step ion-exchange protocol.
Step one used Amberlite IR120 cation exchanger (hydrogen form) (12
g per 500 mL of urine); pH readings were taken and confirmed acidic
conditions resulting from the release of hydrogen ions from the ion-exchange
resin. Step two consisted of the addition of 6 g of Amberlite IRN78
anion exchanger (hydroxide form) per 500 mL of urine from step 1,
followed by pH reading and titration with additional Amberlite IRN78
until neutral pH 7 was reached (resulting from the release of hydroxide
ions from the ion-exchange resin). The urine supernatant was removed
at this point.

Urine Concentration
One liter of
both control and desalted
urine pools were then taken to dryness under a stream of nitrogen
and subsequently resuspended in 100 mL of ultrahigh purity water (in-house
Barnstead Diamond water purification system, Thermo Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA) to give a final 10-fold concentrated sample (10×). Both
the control and desalted urine pools underwent metabolite profiling
using the RPLC-MS method described above for comparison.

Pipeline
Phase 2—Generation of the Fraction Bank
Primary Fractionation and
Formation of the Fraction Bank
A bank of 120 fractions was
created for each of the two concentrated
urine pools using an identical analytical scale system consisting
of a Waters Acquity UPLC system. RPLC-separation was achieved using
a 4.6 mm × 150 mm Atlantis T3 column (Waters Corp.,
Milford, MA, USA). Postcolumn solvent effluent was split using a 1:20
post column splitter, with 1 part diverted to a Waters Xevo TQ-S mass
spectrometer for real-time monitoring and 20 parts diverted to a Waters
Fraction Collector III collection system.

Primary fractionation
employed a linear gradient consisting of 0.1% formic acid in water
(A) and 0.1% formic acid in methanol (B), which provided better resolution
of late eluting metabolites compared to acetonitrile when using large
injection volumes (1 mL). Mobile phase flow rate was 1 mL/min. Initial
conditions of 99% A were held at isocratic conditions for 2.0 min,
followed by a linear gradient elution of 99% A to 80% A in 13.0 min,
which was followed by a linear gradient of 80% A to 50% A in 7.0 min,
and then 50% A to 0% A in a further 4 min and isocratically held for
a further 2 min at 0% A, prior to returning to initial conditions.
To monitor the interinjection precision of the fractionation, full
scan data were collected on a Waters Xevo TQ-S mass spectrometer,
using single mass unit resolution. Data were collected in both positive
ionization mode (100–1200 Da), and negative ionization mode
(100–1200 Da). Masslynx software (Waters, Manchester, U.K.)
was used for data acquisition and visual inspection.

One hundred
replicates of 1 mL injection volume underwent LC separation.
Individual fractions were collected for 15 s across the run creating
a bank of 120 fractions. The LC-MS system was fully cleaned, and a
new column was used for the fractionation of both control and desalted
urine. The remaining fractions were stored at −80 °C in
50 mL Falcon tubes until use.

Fraction Bank Metabolite
Mapping and Assessment of the Desalting
Protocol
Subaliquots (100 μL) of each collected fraction
(from both control and desalted urine) were transferred to 96-well
plates and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Dried plates were then
resuspended in ultra-high-purity water (in-house Barnstead Diamond
water purification system, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and
analyzed using the RP method described above. Raw data underwent peak
picking using Progenesis QI software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle
upon Tyne, UK). This resulted in a “map” of metabolite
locations within the fraction bank.

Pipeline Phase 3—Proof
of Concept Metabolite Annotation
Proof of Concept Feature
Selection
To demonstrate the
applicability of the de novo annotation protocol, four target compounds
were selected for annotation as proof of concept. The four features
were selected from the reversed-phase profiling method to reflect
a range of retention times and physicochemical properties of metabolites.
Two of the features were selected from the same fraction from the
fraction bank to demonstrate the requirement for secondary and tertiary
isocratic fractionations. The fraction bank location matrix described
above facilitates the selection of the fraction with the maximum concentration
of the feature of interest. The fraction containing the highest concentration
of the feature of interest was selected for downstream isocratic purification
and is described in Table 1.

suggesting different hydrophobicity, and therefore challenging the
protocol. NA = no ion observed in respective polarity.

b Fraction bank maximum refers to
the fraction bank stored fraction (1–120) that contains the
highest concentration of the feature of interest.

Secondary and Tertiary Isocratic Fractionation
Secondary
and tertiary fractionation was completed using isocratic separation.
To streamline the method development time, a reference set of conditions
was created using a combination of different reversed-phase columns
and eluents presented in Table S1.

These reference conditions were initially used to identify a developmental
start point and modified accordingly to obtain maximum chromatographic
resolution. This hybrid approach of using an in-house condition library
combined with bespoke modification significantly reduced the overall
chromatographic development time, while maintaining maximum isocratic
chromatographic resolution of fractions.

The flow rate was 1
mL/min, and the column temperature was 35 °C
for all instances for all chromatographic conditions. Full scan data
(50–1200 Da) in both positive and negative ionization modes
were collected on a Waters Xevo G2 QTOF-MS.

Following the secondary
fractionation, the obtained subfractions
underwent metabolite profiling using the in-house RP metabolite profiling
analytical method.25 Subfractions containing
the feature of interest were pooled and taken to dryness under a stream
of nitrogen, before resuspension in a mobile phase (2.2 mL) that matched
the isocratic conditions of tertiary fractionation. Purified features
of interest were pooled for downstream decoupled analysis including
NMR and MRMS, assisting de novo structural elucidation.

MS/MS Analysis
of Concentrated Purified Samples
MS/MS
fragmentation analysis was completed with a Waters Acquity UPLC system
coupled to a Waters Xevo G2 QToF mass spectrometer (Waters Corp.,
Milford, MA, USA). The chromatographic method used the same conditions
as the in-house RP profiling method25 with
the same mass spectrometry source conditions. MS/MS target selection
was performed using unit mass selection via the quadrupole with varying
collision energy (5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 V) or a collision energy voltage
ramp was employed in the collision cell to facilitate fragmentation
(10–45 V).

MRMS Analysis
Magnetic resonance
mass spectra (MRMS)
were acquired with a Bruker solariX 2xR (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica,
MA, US) using electrospray ionization (ESI) and direct infusion with
syringe pump. Mass spectra were acquired with a mass resolution of
1.350.000 at m/z 200 using quadrupolar
detection. Sixty-four single scans were added for the final mass spectrum
(the details are presented in Supporting Information (SI)). Isotopic fine structure calculation was performed with
DataAnalysis software (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, US).

NMR Analysis
The dried fractions of the purified metabolites
were resuspended in 150 μL of LC-MS grade water or the mixture
of D2O 99% D (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% H2O to avoid the disappearance of any NMR signals due to the exchange
with the solvent; 144 μL of this solution was transferred into
an Eppendorf tube together with 16 μL of D2O containing
1 mg/mL of trimethylsilylpropanoic acid (TSP) (Sigma-Aldrich). The
solution was vortexed for 1 min and then centrifuged at 12000g for 5 min at 4 °C; 155 μL of this solution
was transferred into a 3 mm NMR tube. This protocol was adapted from
the publication of Dona et al.26 using
D2O with TSP instead of the phosphate buffer solution as
there was no need to control pH of the purified samples.

1H NMR spectra were acquired using either a 600 MHz Bruker
Avance III HD spectrometer equipped with a BBI room temperature probe, z-gradients, and high-order shims or a 600 MHz Bruker Avance
III spectrometer equipped with a Cryo-TCI triple resonance CryoProbe.
A pulse sequence with two presaturation periods to deplete water signal
was used to obtain the 1D data. Standard Bruker IVDr methods were
used for fraction profiling by NMR26 of
the purified metabolites or their subfractions. 1H NMR
general profile was acquired with a higher number of scans to increase
the signal-to-noise ratio when required due to low concentration.
Other 1H NMR parameters were kept as previously described.26 A range of 2D NMR spectroscopy experiments including J-resolved, 1H,1H–COSY, 1H,1H-TOCSY, 2D 1H,1H-NOESY, 1H,13C-HSQC, and 1H,13C-HMBC
were performed for structural elucidation of the purified metabolites
(the details are presented in SI).

Data Processing
and Analysis
Peak picking of raw LC-MS
data was completed using Progenesis QI software (Nonlinear Dynamics,
Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). This provided a matrix of features within
each fraction and was utilized as a feature reference location map
to facilitate the identification of the fraction of maximum concentration
for each feature of interest.

The subfractions obtained from
isocratic purification of the metabolite of interest were profiled
by 1H NMR using the protocol described by Dona et al. for
human urine samples.26 Fourier transform,
phasing, baseline correction, and calibration were done after acquisition
using TopSpin 3.5 (Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Rheinstetten, Germany) and
then transferred to MATLAB R2016a (Mathworks) as a matrix of intensities
for each part per million value of the spectra. All peaks detected
in the UHPLC-MS profiles of the subfractions of the metabolites of
interest were integrated using TargetLynx software (Waters, Manchester,
U.K.) and transferred as a matrix of peak areas to MATLAB R2016a (Mathworks).
These two matrices were combined to perform statistical spectroscopic
analysis (SHY).27 The MS vector of a peak
area was correlated to the full-scan NMR spectra using Spearman correlation
to infer the linkage of the MS signals and the NMR peaks of a metabolite.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed in SIMCA 14.1
(Umetrics, Sweden).

Results and Discussion
Pipeline Phase 1—Bulk
Urine Preparation
The
pipeline uses an initial one-liter volume of urine to create the fraction
bank. The need for a large volume is a potential limitation of the
pipeline as samples from clinical studies are often volume-limited.
However, many clinically relevant metabolites (e.g., disease diagnostics
or prognostics) are also typically present in the biofluids of healthy
individuals. Therefore, the generation of the fraction bank can be
performed with urine collected from volunteer populations or purchased
from commercial suppliers. In this regard urine is an ideal biofluid
for the pipeline due to the possibility for the noninvasive collection
of large volumes (e.g., via routine 24h collections which typically
produce liters of biofluid per day and per person). Where key biomarker
metabolites are disease or subpopulation specific, the pipeline can
be applied to urine obtained from those individuals or subgroups.

Assessment
of Desalting Urine
Urine is characterized
by the high content of inorganic salts, and their increased amount
in a preconcentrated urine pool in reversed-phase (RP) LC-MS analysis
can cause various problems with both the LC system and retention of
the compounds as well as with their MS and NMR detections. Prior to
fractionation a urine pool underwent a desalting procedure using ion-exchange
resin (Figure 1).

The effect the desalting step caused on the urine profile by MS is
displayed in Figure S1 as heat map plots
of each fraction (number 1–120) against metabolite features
ordered by RP retention time. Panel A shows the untreated control
urine where fractions 1–25 (green circled) appear as a wide
band suggesting poor chromatographic resolution and greater breakthrough
of metabolites through lack of retention. The authors believe this
to be as a result of increased salt content having a detrimental effect
on the chromatographic column. Metabolite features are also visibly
distributed across more fractions in control urine (represented by
wider bands spanning more fractions in the heat map). On the other
hand, the desalted urine heat map (Figure S1a) shows a more linear distribution, while the control urine heat
map has a sigmoidal shape, demonstrating a more even distribution
of metabolites in the fractionation of the desalted urine.

When
operating at analytical scale the number of repeat injections
has to be increased to obtain the concentrations required, therefore
precision of replication is critical. To further assess the fractionation
quality and stability we used principal component analysis (PCA) that
should reflect in the scores plot similarities in unit mass resolution
profiles acquired for each 1 mL injection (Figure S2). The scores for all 100 profiles of desalted 10× urine
are tightly clustered together in comparison to the scores of 100
profiles of untreated 10× urine broadly spread across the PC2.
This highlights how fractions coming from desalted concentrated urine
present more stable retention times for metabolites, increasing replicate
precision and allowing higher column loading, resulting in a more
efficient purification process. The presented desalting approach is
opposite to a traditional use of ion-exchange columns for the extraction
of charged molecules of polar metabolites from biological samples
with their subsequent removal from the resin using acid or base solution
and analysis.25 Therefore, it is unquestionable
that along with the salts the protocol decreases the concentration
of some of the most polar charged metabolites altering the overall
metabolic profile of the desalted urine when compared to the original
one. However, the overall benefit to increasing chromatographic precision
was felt by the authors to outweigh the loss of some metabolite material.
To date, no feature of interest that has been through the protocol
for annotation has been lost by the desalting protocol.

Pipeline
Phase 2—Generation of the Fraction Bank
Primary RP
(RP) fractionation of desalted urine resulted in the collection
of 120 fractions which formed a fraction bank repository stored at
−80 °C. Each fraction was profiled using the in-house
RP phenotyping method in both positive and negative ionization modes.
A feature map was created for each fraction in the bank enabling identification
of those fractions containing features of interest. When these were
found to reside in multiple fractions, the mapping enabled selection
of the fraction with their greatest concentration for downstream isocratic
analysis.

To streamline the collection and initial mapping process,
all eluent was recollected for subsequent isocratic fractionations.
Downstream fractions that contained the feature of interest were collected
and progressed to further purification and analysis, while the remaining
“waste” eluent was dried, resuspended in water, and
returned to the −80 °C fraction bank (Figure S3).

While drying and transfer loss inevitably
occurs, the general metabolic
profile is kept across the chromatogram. This novel fraction bank
approach extends the lifetime of each urine pool and streamlines the
overall pipeline enabling faster annotation without the need of a
new urine collection for subsequent feature assignments.

Selection
of Biomarkers for the Proof-of-Concept
To
demonstrate the protocol and as proof of concept, four metabolite
features were selected for de novo annotation. Selected features represented
a variation of retention times from the in-house RP metabolic phenotyping
assay (Table 1). MS/MS
fragmentation data suggested some structural properties of the metabolites.

Feature A eluted at 2.01 min on the phenotyping assay and was selected
because it is a relatively polar species. MS/MS fragmentation had
suggested that the feature was not a phase II metabolite (e.g., a
glucuronide or sulfate), and therefore would produce a different challenge
to the protocol than B, C, and D.

MS/MS fragmentation indicated
that Feature B (retention time of
4.38 min) and D (retention time of 9.24 min) were both glucuronides;
however, a retention time separation of 4.86 min, suggested different
structural families. Feature B was selected as it eluted closely to
two isomers and would therefore be an appropriate challenge for the
protocol.

Feature C eluted in the same fraction as B, and it
was selected
to demonstrate the requirement of secondary and tertiary fractionations
in relation to Feature B, and the beneficial implementation of statistical
heterospectroscopy in the protocol.

Secondary and tertiary conditions
were selected for each of the
metabolite features of interest based on the generation of the in-house
isocratic reference conditions (Table S1). Two complementary sets of separation conditions were chosen that
best isolated each of the features of interest. This work flow was
developed to streamline the pipeline and create a “walk-up”
design, which greatly reduces the time required for each feature purification
as time-consuming customizable method development is bypassed.

Structure
Elucidation of Urinary Biomarkers—Feature A
Feature
A (Table 1) was the
most polar of the selected metabolites eluting at 2.01
min in the RP chromatography metabolic profiling method described.
Its purification using analytical scale RP chromatography required
the highest percentage of the aqueous phase A, employing 90% in the
secondary fractionation and 99% in the tertiary fractionation (Table S1).

Initial HRMS data collected
by QTOF-MS generated the molecular formula C17H22N2O7 (Waters i-FIT elemental composition calculator).
The search of candidate structures in Pubchem28 returned 605 theoretical candidates while HMDB yielded two theoretical
metabolites tetrahydropentoxyline and semilepidinoside B. QTOF MS/MS
analysis performed on starting urine material (Figure S4) gave the main fragment ion at m/z 245.094 indicating loss of 120 Da characteristic
of C-glycosides.29 Tetrahydropentoxyline
is a C-glycoside while semilepidinoside is an O-glycoside therefore
tetrahydropentoxyline became the most likely candidate. Additionally,
tetrahydropentoxyline has been previously reported as a metabolite
excreted in urine of normal subjects.30

Feature A was found to be at a maximum concentration in fraction
bank 44. This was used for secondary and tertiary purification using
the conditions in Table S1. Following this,
a final purified collection of feature A was sent for downstream NMR
and MRMS analysis.

MRMS (Figure S5) confirmed the elemental
composition C17H22N2O7, while complete structural elucidation of feature A was then performed
by NMR spectroscopy. The result of which was consistent with previously
reported data.30

The full assignment
of the structure of teterahydropentoxyline
purified in this work (Figure 2) is presented in the Table S2 together
with the 2D NMR data Figures S6 and S7.

Figure 2 Structures

using the proposed pipeline and characterized by MS, NMR, and MRMS
spectroscopic analyses.

Structure Elucidation of Urinary Biomarkers—Feature B
Feature B was observed in RP metabolite profiling in both positive
and negative polarities (ES+ and ES−) eluting at 4.37 min.
In ES+, the sodium adduct ion was dominant and the deprotonated ion
was dominant in ES– 374.085 m/z and 350.088 m/z, respectively.
The tube location in the fraction bank that contained the highest
amount of feature B was identified as 87; this was used for secondary
and tertiary isocratic purification.

Feature B was selected
for a proof of concept as it presented a number of significant challenges,
including chromatographic elution with nearby peaks of an identical m/z, and chromatographic coelution with
a peak of high intensity and concentration.

Chromatographic Coelution
The
first challenge that Feature B presented to the pipeline was that
it existed in a complicated space in the chromatographic run (Figure S8). Feature B directly coeluted with
a feature of high intensity (m/z 187.007), depicted with a dashed line on the chromatogram in Figure S8. The coelutant was known to be p-cresol sulfate, and is a major urinary metabolite of gut
microbial origin in metabolic profiling known to exist at high concentrations.
The coelutant was successfully removed in the secondary fractionation.
This demonstrates the successful application of multiple rounds of
purification in a complex mixture such as urine, enabling the physical
purification of coeluting features of interest, which can be difficult
to purify in a single step.

Feature B also presented chromatographic
elution alongside nearby peaks of an identical m/z. This can be observed from the ES– chromatogram
presented in the Figure S8.

First,
it had to be determined if feature B was an individual metabolite
feature or if it was a split peak on the chromatographic profile.
This was achieved using QTOF-MS/MS collision energy dependent analysis
(Figure S9a and S9b). By repeating QTOF-MS/MS
fragmentation with 5 V step intervals of fixed collision energy relative
intensity of each fragment was plotted (Figure S9c). Differences in the relative fragment intensity at varying
collision energies suggested each chromatographic peak was represented
by compounds with a different structural arrangement and therefore
differing bond energies and hence fragment ion ratios. Therefore,
feature B was an ideal candidate to examine if the pipeline could
be used to purify and annotate features that had closely eluting isomers
that would share similarities in chemical structure and therefore
behave similarly chromatographically.

Initially, QTOF-MS was
used to generate a high resolution accurate
mass and therefore predict the elemental composition of the feature
(C16H17NO8). QTOF-MS/MS had ES–
fragment ions indicative of the presence of a glucuronide moiety (fragment
ions 175.024 m/z and 113.024 m/z). Through database searching (Pubchem,28 HMDB,2 Metlin,1 and ChEBI31) yielded
a favored candidate, indole-3-acetic-acid-O-glucuronide.

Following a successful two-step isocratic fractionation, a purified
sample of Fraction B was achieved and was then decoupled from the
pipeline and progressed to structural annotation via 1H
NMR spectroscopy and MRMS (Figure S10).

Feature B Challenge 2: Stability during NMR Analysis
Initially,
the NMR analysis of the extracted features was completed
by resuspending the purified Feature B into a phosphate buffer solution
used for the NMR profiling of urine samples.26 However, it was observed that the metabolite was unstable in the
buffer solution during the 2D NMR acquisition experiments.

The 1H NMR spectra confirmed that the feature of interest was transforming
over time to the isomeric species i and ii (Figure S11). This irreversible transformation was also confirmed by
UHPLC-MS analysis of the NMR solution of the metabolite of interest
(Figure S11).

The ability of acyl
glucuronides to undergo spontaneous hydrolysis
and intramolecular rearrangements is well documented.32,33 It has been previously reported that the glycosidic ester bond can
migrate from position 1 to positions 2, 3, and 4 of glucuronic acid,
and the rearrangement takes place in phosphate buffer solution at
pH 8.0.33 The first step of the transformation
from position 1 to position 2 is irreversible followed by further
reversible steps.33 In addition, the double
UHPLC peaks for the isomers is thought to result from the simultaneous
presence of both α and β anomers of glucuronic acid, which
can also explain more complex shape of the 1H NMR peaks
of the isomers compared to the NMR signals of the pure metabolite
of interest (Figure S11).

To avoid
the instability of the metabolite of interest in solution,
the feature was repurified and the NMR spectroscopic analyses were
run in D2O containing only TSP as a reference signal. In
this way, the feature was stable in solution for the whole duration
of the 2D NMR characterization including 1H–1H COSY and 1H–1H TOCSY experiments
to detect intercorrelations between the protons, and 1H–13C HSQC and 1H–13C HMBC experiments
to detect the intercorrelations between protons and carbons in the
molecule. The metabolite of interest, Feature B, was annotated as
indole-3-acetic-acid-O-alpha-glucuronide. The full
assignment is shown in the Table S3, and
2D NMR spectra for the metabolite of interest are presented in Figures S12 and S13.

Structure
Elucidation of Urinary Biomarkers—Feature C
To annotate
feature B, a two-step physical purification was required,
however the pipeline was also tested to see if a computation purification
step through statistical heterospectroscopy (SHY)27 could be implemented in the annotation of some molecular
species. Feature C was an unknown metabolite at the time of purification
with an m/z of 283.082 that was
also present in fraction bank 87 along with feature B.

Initially,
the elemental composition of feature C was predicted using high resolution
QTOF-MS data on the primary negative ion (283.082 m/z) which was identified as C13H16O7. MS/MS analysis (ES−) of feature C was
consistent with the presence of glucuronide moiety—the loss
of 176 Da and the detection of characteristic fragments of glucuronic
acid (Figure S14a). The feature also shared
similar fragment ions with p-cresol sulfate (107.05 m/z) that suggested p-cresol
within the structure. Database searching (Pubchem,28 HMDB,2 Metlin,1 and ChEBI31) suggested p-cresol glucuronide as a potential candidate.

A lack
of purity meant it was not possible to immediately annotate
the unknown from NMR spectra. To overcome this, several subfractions
were collected with a distribution of the feature over five subfractions.
These were analyzed by UHPLC-QTOF-MS and 1H NMR spectroscopy.
The integrals of the UHPLC-QTOF-MS signals of the unknown in all subfractions
were obtained from the profiles acquired in negative ionization mode
(m/z 283.082) and were correlated
to the full scan 1H NMR spectra using SHY (see Methods).
This enabled the identification of the NMR spectral peaks that were
specifically associated with Feature C (Figure S14b).

The resultant 1H NMR spectrum was annotated
and found
to have similarities with the NMR pattern of p-cresol
sulfate: two doublets in aromatic region at 7.06 (d) and 7.23 (d)
ppm (Figure 2—signals
3,5 and signals 2,6, respectively) indicating p-substitution
in aromatic ring (Figure S14c.i); the intense
singlet at 2.30 (s) ppm for the methyl group of cresol (Figures S14c.ii and 2,
signal 7), and the signals in the sugar region 3.4–4 ppm and
a doublet at 5.07 ppm correspond to glucuronic moiety (Figures S14c.iii and 2, signals 1′–5′). Signals in the 1H NMR were integrated to confirm the number of hydrogens in each
of the chemical groups. These MS/MS and NMR data together confirm
the annotation of feature C as p-cresol glucuronide
(Figure 2) that has
been previously annotated in animal urine.34,35

This example together with p-cresol sulfate
show
that the pipeline is capable to readily extract urinary metabolites
of gut-microbial origin for which the authentic standards can be rarely
available. The combination of high-resolution MS and NMR spectroscopic
analyses together with statistical spectroscopic methods provide a
fast way for annotating these metabolites.

Structure Elucidation of
Urinary Biomarkers—Feature D
Feature D was selected
to test the pipeline as it was a late eluting
feature in RP chromatography. The feature was readily purified under
the RP chromatographic conditions that were rapidly generated from
the in-house isocratic database described in the methods (Table S1) because of its high retention time
in the initial RP UHPLC-MS profiling (9.23 min), and therefore, higher
hydrophobicity compared to the other three features reported in this
study. Both HRMS QTOF-MS (Figure S15) and
MRMS (Figure S16) analyses generated the
molecular formula as C27H44O8.

Following database searching (Pubchem,28 HMDB,2 Metlin,1 and ChEBI31), a potential candidate was
suggested as pregnanediol-3-glucuronide. The presence of glucuronide
moiety was confirmed by QTOF MS/MS analysis (Figure S15) through the loss of 176 Da and detection of characteristic
fragment of glucuronic acid in negative polarity. In this instance,
the standard of pregnanediol-3-glucuronide was available for purchase,
and it underwent analysis by UHPLC-MS/MS and 1D 1H NMR
spectroscopy along with the purified metabolite, which confirmed the
identity of feature D (Figure 2). The NMR spectroscopic characterization of pregnanediol-3-glucuronide
and the full assignment was performed. The spectra and the data are
shown in SI (Figures S17 and S18 and Table S4). Although
pregnanediol-3-glucuronide has previously been reported as a biomarker
in NMR metabolomics,36 this is the first
time that the full NMR assignment of pregnanediol-3-glucuronide has
been detailed in the literature.

Conclusions
Here,
we present a systematic pipeline designed to structurally
elucidate and increase the annotation confidence of unknowns in urine
metabolic profiling. These biomarkers are features of interest in
clinical/epidemiological studies and their structural elucidation
is key for the biological interpretation of the results. By implementation
of a novel ion exchange approach to desalt urine, high precision multiple
repeat fractionation can be implemented using analytical scale chromatography
instrumentation typical of a metabolite profiling laboratory, without
purchasing specialist preparative scale equipment. Minimal column
degradation was observed after multiple repeat injections of one milliliter
of concentrated urine, providing a significant benefit to nondesalted
urine.

The systematic pipeline results in the initial formation
of a reusable
fraction bank that can become a laboratory resource and revisited
without time-consuming bulk urine preparation. Downstream purification
can be done either through physical secondary and tertiary chromatographic
fractionation, or by using computational purification, via statistical
heterospectroscopy in combination with NMR. To streamline the secondary
and tertiary chromatographic steps, an in-house reference library
of reversed-phase conditions was used to select a development start
point that enabled rapid optimization to obtain maximum chromatographic
resolution.

The proposed fraction bank workflow is advantageous
as purified
metabolites can be decoupled from the pipeline at each stage and can
be sent to a combination of downstream analytical technologies, including
MRMS and NMR spectroscopy for increased confidence in structural elucidation.
The pipeline is particularly relevant where analytical standards cannot
be purchased, for example with biotransformed metabolites, such as
glucuronides, and an increase in confidence is required.

A limitation
of the pipeline is the length of time required for
complete purification and structural elucidation of unknowns. Therefore,
to help reduce this time window, a library of isocratic conditions
was created to help enable the rapid selection of secondary and tertiary
separation conditions. However, despite this, overall pipeline time
scales remain constrained by the complexity of the NMR spectroscopic
data and the time taken for interpretation. For instance, in the present
work the structural elucidation of the feature C (p-cresol glucuronide)
took just several days while the full structure assignment by NMR
of the Feature D (pregnanediol-3-glucuronide), which was not previously
reported in the literature and online databases, required several
weeks due to the highly complex NMR spectra. Therefore, the pipeline
is most suitable for scenarios where structural elucidation is critical
for the understanding and interpretation of the biology behind key
statistically significant metabolites that would otherwise remain
unannotated and unknown.
