We
describe a method for addressing redox enzymes adsorbed on a
carbon electrode using synchrotron infrared microspectroscopy combined
with protein film electrochemistry. Redox enzymes have high turnover
frequencies, typically 10–1000 s–1, and therefore,
fast experimental triggers are needed in order to study subturnover
kinetics and identify the involvement of transient species important
to their catalytic mechanism. In an electrochemical experiment, this
equates to the use of microelectrodes to lower the electrochemical
cell constant and enable changes in potential to be applied very rapidly.
We use a biological cofactor, flavin mononucleotide, to demonstrate
the power of synchrotron infrared microspectroscopy relative to conventional
infrared methods and show that vibrational spectra with good signal-to-noise
ratios can be collected for adsorbed species with low surface coverages
on microelectrodes with a geometric area of 25 × 25 μm2. We then demonstrate the applicability of synchrotron infrared
microspectroscopy to adsorbed proteins by reporting potential-induced
changes in the flavin mononucleotide active site of a flavoenzyme.
The method we describe will allow time-resolved spectroscopic studies
of chemical and structural changes at redox sites within a variety
of proteins under precise electrochemical control.

==== Body
Infrared
(IR) microspectroscopy
has been applied to biological systems for cell and tissue mapping,1−5 for example, for probing the subcellular distribution of anticancer
agents,6 characterization of adrenal gland
tumors,7 probing H/D exchange in live cells,8 and analysis of hydration water around proteins.9 Here, we make use of synchrotron IR microspectroscopy
to develop a method for addressing specific chemical changes at sites
within redox proteins in response to electrochemically induced changes
in oxidation state.

Direct electrochemical control is an important
tool for the study
of redox proteins. In the technique known as protein film electrochemistry,
a redox protein is immobilized on an electrode such that electrons
transfer directly to or from its redox cofactors when the electrode
is polarized at an appropriate potential.10,11 This approach is particularly valuable in studying enzymes responsible
for catalyzing oxidation and reduction reactions, as the electrode
potential can be used to trigger catalysis. The electrocatalytic current
reports on the activity of the enzyme at each potential and the ways
in which the enzyme responds to introduction of substrates or inhibitors.

In order to combine direct electrochemical control with structural
and mechanistic insight into chemistry occurring at redox sites within
enzymes, high sensitivity spectroscopic techniques, capable of providing
chemical information on mechanistically useful time scales, are necessary.12−14 The sensitivity requirement arises due to the low surface coverages
achievable with electrode-immobilized redox enzymes, typically on
the order of 1–2 pmol cm–2.15 This means that only a small number of active sites are
being addressed in comparison to surface science studies of small
molecule adsorbates on metal electrodes, for example. Several spectroelectrochemical
approaches have been developed for immobilized proteins, including
UV–visible spectroscopy at transparent metal oxide electrodes,16−18 fluorescence19,20 or surface enhanced infrared
absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy21,22 at gold electrodes,
and various surface enhanced Raman spectroscopies,23,24 most commonly at silver electrodes. We recently demonstrated an
attenuated total reflectance IR (ATR-IR) approach for studying redox
enzymes immobilized on high surface area carbon electrodes,25,26 exploiting the ease of adsorption of many proteins onto carbon surfaces.
The relative chemical inertness of carbon to competing small molecule
activation reactions makes it a useful electrode material for studying
enzyme electrocatalysis.

In order to extend steady-state turnover
studies to subturnover
time-resolved investigations, it is necessary to initiate a reaction
in the immobilized enzyme by applying an experimental trigger that
is fast on the time scale of interest. This equates to applying a
potential rapidly at the electrode (on subsecond to millisecond time
scales) to be compatible with the high turnover frequencies of redox
enzymes, often on the order of 10–1000 s–1. The electrochemical time constant (i.e., the product of solution
resistance and double layer capacitance) at the macro-electrodes typically
used in biological spectroelectrochemistry compromises the achievable
experimental time resolution. This arises because there is greater
double layer capacitance in response to a potential step at the electrode–electrolyte
interface for a high surface area electrode. For example, the geometric
electrode area in the ATR-IR approach we have reported is approximately
43 mm2.25 Significantly improved
electrochemical dynamics have been achieved in reflection–absorption
microspectroscopy studies which have been applied to surface-enhanced
detection of CO adlayers on Pt microelectrodes27,28 and to diffusion-limited reduction of a ferricyanide solution at
gold microelectrodes.29,30 We now describe a reflection–absorption
microspectroscopic method for studying low coverages of redox enzymes,
under electrocatalytic turnover conditions, adsorbed on a carbon particle
electrode. Use of a miniaturized high surface area electrode provides
a compromise between spectroscopic sensitivity and electrochemical
response time (vide infra). In combination with the bright synchrotron
IR microbeam available at the MIRIAM (Multimode InfraRed Imaging and
Microspectroscopy) beamline of the Diamond Light Source, UK, this
approach improves the spectroscopic signal by a factor of between
100 and 1000 times in the mid to far IR range.

We demonstrate
surface electrochemical synchrotron infrared microspectroscopy
here applied to the biological flavin cofactor. The flavin moiety
undergoes a reversible 2-electron 2-proton redox reaction centered
at the isoalloxazine ring as shown in Scheme 1.31 The flavin
core is found in vitamin B2 (riboflavin) and is modified in the biologically
relevant forms of flavin, flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and flavin
adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which are critical to a wide range of
cellular processes including the catalytic reduction of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H to store reducing equivalents from photosynthesis,
catalytic oxidation of NADH by the multisubunit enzyme complex 1 during
respiration, and catalysis of certain dehydrogenation and O2 activation reactions. Both the FMN active site and nearby amino
acid residues in the protein have infrared spectroscopic markers that
are sensitive to the redox reaction shown in Scheme 1.32,33 We report electrochemically
induced difference spectra for FMN immobilized on a carbon black electrode
and within an immobilized flavoenzyme, the NuoF subunit of respiratory
complex I from Escherichia coli.

Scheme 1 Reversible Reduction
of the Isoalloxazine Ring of Flavin Cofactors
Experimental Section
Particle Preparation
Carbon black
particles were dispersed
in water by ultrasonication (20 mg mL–1, Black Pearls
2000, Cabot Corporation). The dispersed particles were then modified
by adsorption of FMN (from a 10 mM solution, Sigma), NouF cell-free
extract (CE) containing overexpressed flavoprotein (the 52 kDa NuoF
subunit of E. coli complex I; see Supporting Information S1), or NuoF-deficient
CE in the dark at 4 °C for 1 h. In order to remove unadsorbed
material, the particles were washed with several aliquots of N2-saturated potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 6.0) containing
100 mM KCl as background electrolyte. After washing, the particles
were transferred to an inert atmosphere glovebox (<1 ppm of O2, Glove Box Technology Ltd.) and stored in the dark prior
to use.

Synchrotron IR Microspectroscopy
Microspectroscopy
experiments were carried out on the MIRIAM beamline at the Diamond
Light Source, UK, using a Vertex 80V FT-IR spectrometer and a Hyperion
3000 IR microscope (Bruker) with a high-sensitivity photovoltaic mercury
cadmium telluride (MCT) detector cooled to 77 K. Spectra were acquired
in reflection mode using a 36× objective and 25 × 25 μm2 aperture, as an average of 1024 interferograms at 4 cm–1 resolution. Data acquisition was performed using
Bruker Optik’s OPUS software (version 7.0).

ATR-IR Spectroscopy
ATR-IR spectra were recorded as
previously described,25 using the external
beam of a 680-IR spectrometer (Varian) diverted into an anaerobic
glovebox (<1 ppm of O2, Glove Box Technology Ltd.) housing
a multiple-reflection ATR accessory (GladiATR, PIKE Technologies)
and a narrow-band MCT detector. High surface area particle electrodes
were formed by drop-casting a 1 μL aliquot of FMN-modified particles
onto a Si internal reflection element (8.39 × 5 × 1 mm3, face angle of 39°, Crystal GmbH) sealed into a polyether
ether ketone (PEEK) base. The electrodes are highly porous with a
layer thickness of roughly 3–5 μm: characterization of
similar particle electrodes formed from a range of carbon materials
has been discussed previously.34 Carbon
paper (Toray, TGP-H-030) was placed on top of the deposited particles
to ensure lateral electronic connectivity. The spectroelectrochemical
cell body, containing a miniature saturated calomel reference electrode,
a Pt wire counter electrode (Surepure Chemetals, 99.99%, 26 gauge),
and a carbon rod working electrode connection, was sealed onto the
base and filled with N2-saturated potassium phosphate buffered
electrolyte. Data acquisition was performed using Agilent Resolutions
Pro software.

All data analysis was carried out using OriginPro
software (OriginLab Corp.). Electrochemical control was provided by
an Autolab 128N potentiostat. Electrochemical characterization of
NuoF CE was performed by adsorbing the enzyme onto a freshly sanded
pyrolytic graphite “edge” electrode which was then immersed
in potassium phosphate buffered electrolyte containing 1 mM NAD+ and 1 mM NADH (Prozomix). Potentials were converted to V
vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) using the conversion E(SHE) = E(SCE) + 242 mV at 25 °C.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
reflection–absorption cell used to carry out combined spectroscopic-electrochemical
measurements by synchrotron microspectroscopy (Figure S2). A glassy carbon rod working electrode (1 mm diameter,
Alfa Aesar) was sealed into a Delrin holder using resin (Araldite).
The glassy carbon was polished to a mirror finish using successive
grades of silicon carbide paper (to 4000 grit, Kemet). A Pt wire counter
electrode (Surepure Chemetals, 99.99%, 26 gauge) was housed in a groove
around the working electrode and was removable to prevent contamination
of the working electrode surface with Pt during polishing. A miniature
saturated calomel reference electrode25 was placed close to the working electrode to minimize uncompensated
resistance. In order to form a high surface area electrode, the as-prepared
carbon black particles were drop-cast onto the working electrode and
the cell was sealed against a 2 mm thick CaF2 window (Crystran).
The path length of the cell could be controlled either by adjusting
the height of the working electrode within the cell (with a 32 threads
per inch screw thread) or using a 12.5 μm PTFE spacer (Harrick),
in order to minimize absorption losses to bulk water. The cell was
filled with N2-saturated phosphate buffered electrolyte
through two filling holes that allow operation as a flow cell.

Figure 1 Exploded diagram
of the reflection–absorption electrochemical
microspectroscopy cell (not to scale; see Figure S2). The glassy carbon working electrode is modified with a
layer of carbon black particles, and the path length of the cell can
be adjusted to account for small differences in layer thickness between
measurements.

Figure 2 shows current–time
traces recorded during a series of potential steps corresponding to
repeated reduction (−0.558 V) and reoxidation (+0.242 V) of
adsorbed FMN in the microspectroscopy cell (solid) and the ATR-IR
cell (dashed). The capacitive contribution to the current persists
for several hundred seconds with the high surface area electrode in
the ATR-IR cell but contributes for only a few seconds in the microspectroscopy
cell (Figure S3). The carbon black particles
used in this study have a specific surface area of 1332 m2/g.34 A typical high surface area electrode
in the ATR-IR cell contains 2 × 10–5 g of carbon
black (1 μL of a 20 mg/mL dispersion), and so, the total electrode
surface area is approximately 266 cm2. In the microspectroscopy
cell, the total electrode surface area is approximately 5 cm2 (for a comparable particle deposition of ca. 1 μm thickness,25 as the geometric area is 54 times lower than
in the ATR-IR cell). This is still quite high and reflects the deposition
of particles onto a large (1 mm diameter in the present microspectroscopy
cell) supporting electrode. Carbon microelectrodes with diameters
as small as 7 μm are commercially available, and even smaller
electrodes can be fabricated using carbon fiber; thus, it will be
possible to decrease the total surface area of the particle electrode
further by employing a suitable deposition strategy. A conservative
estimate of the electrochemical time constant achievable using this
particle electrode microspectroscopic method is roughly 50 μs.
(The electrochemical time constant of a cell using a microelectrode
can be on the order of 1 μs,30 and
a typical particle electrode deposited onto a 7 μm microelectrode
increases the total surface area by a factor of approximately 50.)
This demonstrates the clear advantages of a microspectroscopic approach
for electrochemically triggered time-resolved experiments that are
capable of probing chemically useful time scales.

Figure 2 Electrochemistry of FMN
adsorbed on carbon black particles. Current–time
trace showing a series of potential steps in the ATR-IR (dashed) and
reflection–absorption microspectroscopy (solid) cells. The
geometric areas of the electrodes are approximately 43 mm2 (ATR-IR) and 0.8 mm2 (microspectroscopy). In the microspectroscopy
cell, spectra initiated at times indicated with an ∗ were used
to calculate the difference spectrum shown in Figure 3. Potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6, containing
100 mM KCl was used as background electrolyte.

Figure 3 compares spectra obtained using the ATR-IR
and synchrotron
microspectroscopy approaches, using the reversible 2-electron 2-proton
reduction of adsorbed FMN as a model system. Scheme 1 shows the overall reaction occurring at
the electrode surface, and Figure 3 shows oxidized minus reduced difference
spectra following a potential step from +0.242 to −0.558 V.
In these difference spectra, positive going bands correspond to species
that are present at oxidizing potentials and negative going bands
correspond to species that are present at reducing potentials. The
difference spectrum collected using the ATR-IR approach (dashed, large
scale bar) shows approximately 40 times lower signal than that using
the synchrotron microspectroscopic approach (solid, small scale bar,
calculated from spectra initiated at the times indicated with an ∗
in Figure 2), demonstrating
a large sensitivity gain using the synchrotron microspectroscopy approach
despite spectral acquisition from only a 25 × 25 μm2 area of the supporting electrode (Figure S4). The general features of the difference spectra in Figure 3 are consistent with
those previously reported for FMN in solution32,33 although the peak positions are shifted, consistent with the peaks
arising from adsorbed FMN rather than FMN in solution. The peak positions
in both difference spectra overlap very well, showing that FMN behaves
in the same way in both the ATR-IR and reflection–absorption
microspectroscopy cells. The electrochemically induced oxidation and
reduction of adsorbed FMN in the microspectroscopy cell is fully reversible
and reproducible over several potential steps (Figure S5). In principle, therefore, the microspectroscopy
cell can be used to collect time-resolved data by coaveraging data
over successive cycles.

Figure 3 Spectroelectrochemistry of FMN adsorbed on carbon
black particles.
Oxidized minus reduced difference spectra recorded
in the ATR-IR (dashed) and reflection–absorption microspectroscopy
(solid) cells. Difference spectra were calculated from spectra collected
at +0.242 and −0.588 V as an average of 1024 interferograms.
The spectrum recorded in the microspectroscopy cell was acquired from
a 25 × 25 μm2 geometric area of the electrode,
from spectra initiated at the times indicated with an ∗ in Figure 2. Potassium phosphate
buffer, pH 6, containing 100 mM KCl was used as background electrolyte.

Precise band assignment of the
spectra in Figure 3 is complicated by the lack of consistency
of assignment in the literature, both experimentally and computationally
(band positions are sensitive to sample age, choice of buffer, pH,
and whether the FMN has been subject to visible illumination before
or during the measurement). However, in Figure 3, oxidized FMN exhibits C=O bands
at ca. 1706 and 1620 cm–1 (in the microspectroscopic
case, this latter band is convoluted with a potential-induced change
in the H–O–H bend of water at the electrode interface,
at ca. 1660 cm–1, reflecting the interfacial sensitivity
of the microspectroscopic method relative to the ATR-IR) and bands
due to the isoalloxazine ring at roughly 1576, 1541, and 1506 cm–1. Reduced FMN has contributions from the isoalloxazine
ring at ca. 1587, 1560, and 1517 cm–1. Negative
features due to the broad N–H wag modes at ∼1400 cm–1 confirm that reduction has taken place, as these
are not present in the oxidized form (Scheme 1). Additional detail in the synchrotron microspectroscopy
data (above the signal-to-noise ratio achieved during the measurement, Figure S5) at 1497 and 1475 cm–1 emphasizes the increased sensitivity of the synchrotron microspectroscopy
technique, as weak contributions from CH2 deformations
in the phosphate-containing side chain of FMN (Scheme 1) are expected in the region below 1500 cm–1.

Figure 4 shows an
oxidized minus reduced difference spectrum for electrode-adsorbed
flavoenzyme NuoF CE, collected in the microspectroscopy cell following
a potential step from +0.242 to −0.558 V. The surface coverage
of NuoF CE is much lower than the surface coverage of FMN,13 so the overall intensity of the difference spectrum
is much smaller (Figure S6 shows the difference
spectrum relative to the baseline noise level of the microspectroscopic
measurement). Nonetheless, the general form of the difference spectrum
in the 1400–1600 cm–1 region is similar for
both the protein-bound and adsorbed FMN. A clear positive peak at
1540 cm–1 is characteristic of oxidized flavin,
and a smaller positive peak at 1522 cm–1 is similar
to that in Figure 3 arising from the isoalloxazine ring. Negative peaks at 1556, 1545,
and 1511 cm–1 are similar to those of reduced FMN.
Further peaks in the NuoF CE difference spectrum are probably due
to changes in amide band structure that occur due to changes in protonation
during the reduction of the FMN active site and potential-induced
reorientation of the protein on the electrode.35 Differences in peak position between FMN in solution,32 adsorbed FMN (Figure 3), and protein-bound FMN (Figure 4) provides evidence that the
FMN remains protein-bound during the course of our measurements. Confirmation
that the FMN active site remains protein-bound upon adsorption is
provided by the catalytic competence of NuoF CE adsorbed on carbon
toward both NAD+ reduction and NADH oxidation, as shown
in the cyclic voltammogram in the inset of Figure 4. Similar spectroscopic and electrochemical
measurements on NuoF-deficient cell-free extract showed no detectable
FMN redox chemistry or any electrocatalytic NAD+ reduction
or NADH oxidation activity (Figures S7 and S8).

Figure 4 Spectroelectrochemistry of NuoF cell-free extract adsorbed on carbon
black particles. Oxidized minus reduced difference
spectrum, recorded in the microspectroscopy cell, showing spectroscopic
changes in the flavin region. The difference spectrum was calculated
from spectra collected at +0.242 and −0.588 V as an average
of 1024 interferograms. The inset shows a catalytic cyclic voltammogram
(blue) of NuoF CE adsorbed on a pyrolytic graphite “edge”
rotating disc electrode rotating at 2000 rpm in the presence of both
NAD+ and NADH, compared to a cyclic voltammogram recorded
in the absence of NuoF CE (gray). Potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6,
containing 100 mM KCl was used as background electrolyte.

We have developed a combined synchrotron microspectroscopic-electrochemical
technique which offers significant advantages over other techniques
for probing the redox chemistry of electrode-immobilized redox enzymes
in situ. We have demonstrated that the technique can be applied to
flavoproteins using NuoF CE, a small fragment of respiratory complex
1 from E. coli. Although a relatively large
supporting electrode was used in this work, spectroscopic data were
collected from a 25 × 25 μm2 area, highlighting
the scope for further miniaturization by depositing particles onto
microelectrodes (Figure S4). This will
allow the electrochemical time constant to be lowered to approximately
50 μs, better than that achievable by conventional freeze-quench
or stopped flow methods. Protein adsorption on carbon electrodes can
be very robust (we have previously demonstrated stability for several
days with no damage to protein structure or electrochemical response),25 and their electrochemically triggered processes
are generally very repeatable and reproducible, meaning it will be
possible to improve spectroscopic sensitivity further through use
of modulation excitation spectroscopy and phase sensitive detection.
This will allow time-resolved spectroscopic studies of chemical and
structural changes at redox sites within proteins under the precise
electrochemical control provided by protein film electrochemistry.
