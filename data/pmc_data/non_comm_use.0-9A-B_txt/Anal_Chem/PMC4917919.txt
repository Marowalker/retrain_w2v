We developed a technique to monitor
spatially confined surface
reactions with mass spectrometry under ambient conditions, without
the need for voltage or organic solvents. Fused-silica capillaries
immersed in an aqueous solution, positioned in close proximity to
each other and the functionalized surface, created a laminar flow
junction with a resulting reaction volume of ∼5 pL. The setup
was operated with a syringe pump, delivering reagents to the surface
through a fused-silica capillary. The other fused-silica capillary
was connected to a Venturi easy ambient sonic-spray ionization source,
sampling the resulting analytes at a slightly higher flow rate compared
to the feeding capillary. The combined effects of the inflow and outflow
maintains a chemical microenvironment, where the rate of advective
transport overcomes diffusion. We show proof-of-concept where acetylcholinesterase
was immobilized on an organosiloxane polymer through electrostatic
interactions. The hydrolysis of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase
into choline was monitored in real-time for a range of acetylcholine
concentrations, fused-silica capillary geometries, and operating flow
rates. Higher reaction rates and conversion yields were observed with
increasing acetylcholine concentrations, as would be expected.

==== Body
There has
been a recent surge
in method development for studies of chemical reactions in real-time
with MS. Examples include reactive desorption electrospray ionization
(DESI)-MS, where reagents are delivered with an electrospray-ionization
source to a reactive surface.1,2 The droplets bounce
off the surface with dried down reagents and are delivered to the
MS inlet for detection. Another type of setup involves mixing reagents
in a syringe followed by direct infusion to the MS.3−7 Hence, the time-course of the reaction can be followed.
Similarly, reaction kinetics of colliding droplets sprayed from two
different syringes directed at each other have been studied with MS,
resulting in reaction rates higher than those obtained in bulk reactions.8−10 However, all these techniques rely on electrospray ionization, where
several kilovolts of voltage must be applied. Hence, these techniques
are incompatible with studies of voltage-sensitive reactions. Also,
they do not allow studies of live cells, which rapidly would get electroporated
by the high voltage used in electrospray ionization.

We present
a new technique, which allows for real-time interrogation
of surface reactions with MS without the need for voltage. This was
done by coupling a syringe pump connected to a fused-silica capillary
outlet with another fused-silica capillary connected to a Venturi
easy ambient sonic-spray ionization11 (V-EASI)
source. V-EASI does not require voltage to generate charged droplets
and relies instead on stochastically generated imbalances of droplet
net charge. Further, V-EASI has successfully been used to interrogate
several types of analytes, including small molecules, peptides, proteins,
and nucleotides.11−14 With our method, the connection of a V-EASI source to the resulting
laminar flow junction was used to interrogate chemical reactions taking
place on a surface deeply immersed in a liquid. The setup is conceptually
similar to a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR).15 However, because the setup is fully operating in the laminar
flow regime and there is no active stirring, mixing with the bulk
only takes place through diffusion.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). All solvents (MS-grade) were purchased from Thermo
Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA).

Preparation of Organosiloxane
Polymer Slides
The organosiloxane
polymer was prepared by stirring 500 μL of methyltrimethoxysilane
and 225 μL of dimethyldimethoxysilane with 600 μL of 0.12
N acetic acid at room temperature for 30 min. Each of the 12 5 mm
round wells on a Teflon-printed glass slide (Electron Microscopy Sciences,
Hatfield, PA) was filled with 8 μL of reaction solution. The
glass slide was kept in a covered Petri dish during the curing stage
of the polymerization in a 65 °C oven for approximately 21 h.
The resulting organosiloxane polymers were rinsed free of unreacted
starting materials and alcohol byproduct by immersing the slides into
a container of acetonitrile and agitating for 45 min. Any acetonitrile
remaining on the glass slide and polymers were allowed to evaporate
under ambient conditions before deposition of enzyme solution on the
surface of the polymer. When not in use, the polymers were stored
dry at 4 °C.

Immobilization of Acetylcholinesterase
Acetylcholinesterase
was dissolved in 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.8, to a final
concentration of 2 μM. Aliquots of 10 μL were deposited
on the surface of organosiloxane polymers on a glass slide and incubated
overnight at room temperature (22–25 °C). The organosiloxane
polymers were washed with 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate to remove any
unbound acetylcholinesterase. For MS-experiments, the inflowing acetylcholine
of various concentrations was also dissolved in 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate.

Real-Time Mass Spectrometry
Fused-silica tubing purchased
from Polymicro Technologies (Phoenix, AZ) were used for analyte delivery
and sampling. Superfusion was performed with a syringe pump (Harvard
Apparatus, Holliston, MA) connected through a PEEK union (IDEX Health
& Science, Rohnert Park, CA) to a fused-silica capillary. Sampling
was performed with a V-EASI source made from a stainless-steel tee
union (Swagelok, Solon, OH). The fused-silica capillary was fitted
through the tee union and the attached 10 cm stainless-steel capillary
(o.d. 1.59 mm, i.d. 0.51 mm). The fused-silica capillaries were sleeved
with fluorinated ethylene propylene tubing sleeves (IDEX Health &
Science, Rohnert Park, CA) to fit into the stainless-steel tee, PEEK
union (IDEX Health & Science, Rohnert Park, CA) and microelectrode
holders (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) used for fluidic connections. The
microelectrode holders were operated with hydraulic micromanipulators
(Narishige, East Meadow, NY), and the capillary tip positions were
observed with an inverted microscope (Axiovert 135, Carl Zeiss Microscopy,
Thornwood, NY). The microscope was equipped with a motorized xy-translational stage (H107, Prior Scientific, Rockland,
MA) to facilitate rapid movement of the sample slide.

Mass spectrometry
was performed with an LTQ-Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA). Mass spectra were acquired across m/z 50–500. The capillary temperature was set to 350
°C, capillary voltage was 4 kV, with maximum injection time set
to 500 ms per scan for analyte sampling, operating with a N2 gas pressure at the tee inlet.

Modeling and Data Analysis
Fluid dynamics modeling
was performed with COMSOL Multiphysics (COMSOL AB, Stockholm, Sweden).
Data acquired with MS was analyzed with MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick,
MA). Results are presented as the mean ± 1 standard deviation.

Results and Discussion
Liquid-Phase Laminar Flow Junction
The immersed tips
of the fused-silica capillaries were operated with micromanipulators
under a microscope where the microscopy slide holding the sample for
investigation also was placed (Figure 1). Annotated photographs of the setup are shown in Figure S1. By applying a high gas flow in the
V-EASI source, directed in parallel with the outlet of the sampling
capillary, a local pressure drop caused liquid to be pulled through
the capillary and delivered analytes to the inlet of the MS. We performed
fluid dynamics modeling of the system, which showed that the slightly
higher flow rate used for sampling (0.6 μL/min) compared to
the superfusion flow rate (0.5 μL/min) was sufficient to have
achieved Pe > 1 (Péclet number, defined
as
the ratio of advective transport rate to the diffusive transport rate).
As such, a local chemical environment within the bulk solution was
maintained with a volume of ∼5 pL (Figure 2), conceptually similar to superfusion techniques
used for electrophysiological cell-studies.16,17

Real-Time Monitoring of
Hydrolysis of Acetylcholine by Acetylcholinesterase
To provide
proof-of-concept of the capabilities of our system,
we investigated the reaction kinetics of acetylcholinesterase, an
enzyme responsible for termination of acetylcholine signaling in synaptic
neurotransmission through rapid hydrolysis of acetylcholine (Scheme 1).18 Our system monitored the reaction as a function of time
and provided information both about transient and steady-state conversions.
In our studies, acetylcholinesterase was immobilized on an organosiloxane
polymer19 through electrostatic interactions20,21 and was not removed by the relatively low salt concentration (20
mM ammonium bicarbonate) used herein. The flows of the feeding and
sampling capillaries were allowed to equilibrate to achieve a steady-state
concentration within the liquid junction on the glass microscope slide
but outside the area that was functionalized with enzyme. With the
fused-silica capillaries locked in position, the automated xy-translational stage moved the microscope slide such that
the flow junction went from being in contact with the empty untreated
surface to the enzyme surface in ∼100 ms, traveling at 2 mm/s.
To some extent, our system behaved in a similar way as a CSTR, where
the apparent reaction rate is initially high and over time approaches
zero; the time to reach the steady-state condition depends on the
dwell time of molecules within the reaction volume and the kinetics
of the reaction itself. Upon arrival at the enzyme surface, acetylcholine
was rapidly hydrolyzed into choline and a steady-state was achieved
within a few seconds when the feeding concentration was 1 μM
acetylcholine (Figure 3). Representative mass spectra for times before and during exposure
of the liquid junction to acetylcholinesterase are shown in Figure S2. Moving the liquid junction out of
the enzyme area, levels of acetylcholine and choline returned to their
initial levels. By lowering the concentration of acetylcholine, steady-state
conditions took progressively longer time to achieve (Figure 3). Data in the range of transient
kinetics (normalized to maximum intensity) were fitted with a single
exponential of the form 1 – e–kt (Figure S3), yielding apparent
rate constants k (Table 1). In the steady-state condition, the conversion
of acetylcholine into choline XACh (defined
as the difference between inflow and outflow of the acetylcholine
concentration at steady-state divided by the inlet concentration,
using the extracted ion current as a measure of relative concentration)
was progressively higher with higher substrate concentrations (Table 1).

by Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) Yields
Choline and Acetate
Figure 3 Representative traces of real-time mass spectrometry monitoring
conversion of acetylcholine into choline by acetylcholinesterase,
surface-bound to an organosiloxane polymer. Use of a small capillary
inner diameter (o.d. 150 μm, i.d. 50 μm) and low flow
rate (qin = 0.5 μL/min, qout = 0.6 μL/min) allows for a high yield
of conversion. The plots show extracted ion chromatograms for acetylcholine
(ACh, m/z 146.1176) and choline
(Ch, m/z 104.1070). A steady-state
condition was first established outside the enzyme surface, followed
by a rapid movement (∼100 ms) into the enzyme surface, which
caused a perturbation of the reaction conditions, shortly followed
by a new steady-state condition. Moving out from the enzyme surface
restored the reaction to its initial conditions.

0.01	0.195 ± 0.048	0.803 ± 0.062	
In conventional CSTRs
with active mixing, the conversion yield
can be kept constant while scaling up the volume of the system, by
keeping the space time parameter τ (reaction volume-to-flow
ratio) constant. In contrast, Figures 3 and 4 show different conversion
yields during superfusion with 1 μM acetylcholine at the inlet,
where XACh,50 = 0.936 ± 0.046 and XACh,200 = 0.380 ± 0.095 (p = 0.0008, Student’s t-test, n = 3), respectively, while the space time for both systems were similar
(τ50 = 0.2 s and τ200 = 0.3 s),
approximating the reaction volume as a half-sphere centered between
the capillaries. We hypothesize the reason for this difference is
that in contrast to well-mixed CSTRs, the reaction only takes place
on a surface and mixing only occurs through diffusion. In Figure 3, the geometry of
the liquid-flow junction using o.d. 150 μm, i.d. 50 μm
capillaries has a larger base surface-to-volume ratio than in Figure 4, where o.d. 350
μm, i.d. 200 μm capillaries were used. Fluid dynamics
modeling confirmed that a higher yield of conversion is to be expected
(data not shown) with the experimental setup used in Figure 3 (qin = 0.5 μL/min, qout = 0.6 μL/min)
compared to the setup used in Figure 4 (qin = 8 μL/min, qout = 10 μL/min).

Figure 4 Representative traces
of real-time mass spectrometry monitoring
conversion of acetylcholine (ACh, m/z 146.1176) into choline (Ch, m/z 104.1070) by acetylcholinesterase. Use of a large capillary inner
diameter (o.d. 350 μm, i.d. 200 μm) and higher flow rate
(qin = 8 μL/min, qout = 10 μL/min) leads to a low surface-to-volume
ratio in combination with less time for substrate diffusion, resulting
in lower conversion compared to what is obtained with smaller capillaries
and lower flow rates.

Evaluation of Optimal Operating Parameters for Real-Time Mass
Spectrometry
The experimental parameters used herein were
based on an evaluation of the effects of nitrogen-gas pressure, capillary
geometry, and length on signal intensity using a 1 μM acetylcholine
solution dissolved in 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Table 2). A stainless-steel capillary
(o.d. 1.59 mm, i.d. 0.51 mm) was used to hold different sizes of fused-silica
capillaries in the V-EASI source. Increasing pressure within the testing
range and the resulting increased flow rate monotonically improved
the signal intensity for fused-silica capillary with o.d. 350 μm,
i.d. 75 μm. However, for the o.d. 150 μm, i.d. 50 μm
capillary we found a local maximum for signal intensity at 120 psi
nitrogen-gas pressure. The obtained signal intensity (mean and standard
deviation obtained from data points collected over a 1 min time-course)
was comparable to those resulting from the use of larger capillary
sizes but operating at up to 16 times lower flow rate. These results
indicated that with a sampling flow rate of 0.6 μL/min, ultimately
used in this study, we could minimize sample consumption while maintaining
a high signal intensity.

Conclusions
We have shown proof-of-concept for a novel technique which permits
real-time interrogation of liquid-surface reactions with MS without
the need of voltage. Several neurotransmitters and neuropeptides are
nonoxidizable; hence, they cannot be directly detected with conventional
amperometry. We consider that our technique may become complementary
to existing techniques for live-cell measurements in future studies.
