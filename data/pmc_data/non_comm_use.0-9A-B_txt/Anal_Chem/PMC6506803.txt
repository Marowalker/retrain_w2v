Intracellular
nucleotides and acyl-CoAs are metabolites that are
central to the regulation of energy metabolism. They set the cellular
energy charge and redox state, act as allosteric regulators, modulate
signaling and transcription factors, and thermodynamically activate
substrates for oxidation or biosynthesis. Unfortunately, no method
exists to simultaneously quantify these biomolecules in tissue extracts.
A simple method was developed using ion-pairing reversed-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography–electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry
(HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) to simultaneously quantify adenine nucleotides (AMP,
ADP, and ATP), pyridine dinucleotides (NAD+ and NADH),
and short-chain acyl-CoAs (acetyl, malonyl, succinyl, and propionyl).
Quantitative analysis of these molecules in mouse liver was achieved
using stable-isotope-labeled internal standards. The method was extensively
validated by determining the linearity, accuracy, repeatability, and
assay stability. Biological responsiveness was confirmed in assays
of liver tissue with variable durations of ischemia, which had substantial
effects on tissue energy charge and redox state. We conclude that
the method provides a simple, fast, and reliable approach to the simultaneous
analysis of nucleotides and short-chain acyl-CoAs.

==== Body
Adenosine
nucleotides, nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotides, and acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) are present in all
living cells (Figure 1A). They are required as cofactors and units of basic energy transfer
in metabolism. There are three adenosine nucleotides that have one,
two, or three high-energy phosphates: adenosine 5′-monophate
(AMP), adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP), and adenosine 5′-triphosphate
(ATP). The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and AMP is used to drive endergonic
processes of metabolism. Collectively, they define cellular energy
charge (EC), a measure of chemical energy available for metabolic
processes. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) exists in the oxidized
(NAD+) or reduced (NADH) form. NAD(H) is an essential cofactor
for redox reactions in biochemistry and ultimately provides the H+ gradient that drives respiration and ATP synthesis. Together,
EC and the NAD+/NADH ratio describe the energy status of
biological systems and modify cell signaling through the AMPK and
sirtuin pathways.1,2

Figure 1 (A) General roles of adenosine phosphates,
dinucleotides, and short-chain
acyl-CoAs in metabolism and the energy status of liver. Nutrient oxidation
in pathways like glycolysis and fat oxidation captures electrons by
reducing NAD+ to NADH. These pathways also generate acetyl-CoA,
which is oxidized in the TCA cycle to generate more NADH. NADH is
reoxidized to NAD+ in the respiratory chain to drive ATP
synthesis. The conversion of ATP to ADP and AMP supplies the free
energy for multiple pathways of cellular work. Many of these metabolites
can be sensed by regulatory proteins, such as AMPK and sirtuins, or
allosterically modify enzymatic activity to signal for changes in
flux through pathways of nutrient oxidation and biosynthesis. (B)
Analytical methodology designed for the simultaneous quantification
of adenosine phosphates, dinucleotides, and short-chain acyl-CoAs
in tissue samples. Snap-freezing normoxic tissue ensures that physiological
pools of metabolites are preserved. Acid extraction provides sufficient
extraction efficiency for these classes of metabolites. Ion-pairing
with DBAA provides sufficient chromatographic separation of these
classes of metabolites. Positive MS/MS fragments were more efficient
than negative-mode ones under these conditions.

Short-chain acyl-CoAs are also important indicators of energy
status
and function as regulators of downstream pathways that produce or
utilize ATP. Acetyl-CoA is the product of β-oxidation and a
substrate for the TCA cycle, both of which generate the NADH necessary
for ATP production in the electron-transport chain. It is notable
that acetyl-CoA also functions as a required allosteric activator
of pyruvate carboxylase, which is the main anaplerotic pathway of
the TCA cycle. Acetyl-CoA can be converted to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA
carboxylase, the first step in fatty acid and sterol synthesis. Malonyl-CoA
also inhibits lipid oxidation by allosterically inhibiting carnitine
palmitoyltransferase I activity. Therefore, quantification of nucleotides
and short-chain acyl-CoAs is of great value for understanding the
energetics and redox states of tissue (Figure 1A).

Despite their immense importance
and closely related metabolic
roles, the diverse chemical properties of these three classes of metabolites
make them challenging to quantify in a unified analytical approach.
First, adenosine nucleotides are extremely polar, rendering them weakly
retained and poorly resolved by conventional reversed-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC).3,4 Approaches based on
ion-pairing RP-HPLC have been developed for quantifying nucleotides
in cell lysates,5−9 some of which have been coupled with electrospray-ionization mass
spectrometry (ESI-MS) using ion-pairing reagents such as trimethylamine
(TEA), tetrabutylammonium acetate (TBAA), dibutylammonium formate
(DBAF), and dimethylhexylamine (DMHA).10−17 Hence, a general method could use this chromatographic approach.
Second, universal extraction conditions are also difficult to identify.
For example, NAD+ is efficiently extracted from tissue
by standard acid-extraction protocols, but NADH is unstable under
those conditions9,18,19 and is usually extracted with basic media.20 Organic-solvent extraction protocols have been developed to simultaneously
quantify NAD+ and NADH,18,19 but such approaches
have poor yields for more polar adenosine nucleotides. It is known
that NADH undergoes acid-catalyzed degradation to adenosine 5′-diphosphoribose
(ADPR) during acid tissue extraction,21−23 which could be used
as a surrogate for NADH. Finally, tissue short-chain acyl-CoAs can
be measured by GC-MS, but this approach requires careful derivatization24 and is not amenable to the analysis of nucleotides.
LC-MS methods have been developed to directly measure malonyl-CoA25 and other short-chain acyl-CoAs in tissue by
using 13C3-malonyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA as
internal standards.26,27 However, these methods either
do not utilize MS/MS for optimal specificity and sensitivity or lack
specific internal standards. The challenge for a universal method
will be to meet all requirements for each type of biological molecule.

We developed a general LC-MS/MS method (Figure 1B) based on volatile ion-pairing RP-HPLC,
an NADH surrogate, and stable-isotope-labeled internal standards.
We successfully quantified adenosine nucleotides (AMP, ADP, and ATP),
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides (NAD+ and ADPR as a
surrogate for NADH), and short-chain acyl-CoAs (acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA,
succinyl-CoA, and propionyl-CoA). The method had excellent speed,
sensitivity, and selectivity in a single analysis of liver tissue.
We demonstrate that the method detects the rapid changes in energy
and redox known to occur during the onset of ischemia–hypoxia
in mouse liver. This method will be useful for researchers investigating
tissue energetics using basic LC-MS/MS instrumentation.

Chemicals and Materials
All nucleotides and coenzyme

5′-diphosphate (ADP), adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP),
β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate (NAD+), β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced disodium salt

were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Dibutylamine acetate (DBAA,
500 mM) solution was purchase from Sigma. HPLC-grade water, methanol,
and acetonitrile were purchased from VWR (Radnor, PA). Internal standards
(IS) [1,2-13C2] acetyl-CoA lithium salt, [1,2,3-13C3] malonyl-CoA lithium salt, [13C10,15N5] ATP sodium salt, and [13C10,15N5] AMP sodium salt were purchased
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

Sample Preparation
Frozen liver
samples were immediately
spiked with stable-isotope-labeled ATP, AMP, acetyl-CoA, and malonyl-CoA
internal standards. Approximately 50 mg of frozen tissue was homogenized
in 500 μL of 0.4 M HClO4 (PCA) containing 0.5 mM
EGTA, and the tissue remained on ice for 10 min before being centrifuged
at 14 000g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant
(400 μL) was neutralized with 135 μL of 0.5 M K2CO3, and the precipitate (KClO4) was removed
by centrifugation at 14 000g at 4 °C
for 30 min. Neutralized supernatants were stored at −20 °C
before being subjected to LC-MS/MS analyses.

Instrumentation
All experiments were carried out on
a Shimadzu LC-20AD liquid chromatography (LC) system coupled to an
API 3200 electrospray-ionization triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer
(AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA). For initial investigation of the product
spectrum of analytes (Figure 2), the standard solutions (1 μg/mL) were directly infused
into the interface by a syringe pump. LC was performed on a reversed-phase
C18 column (Waters xBridge, 150 × 2.1 mm, 3 μm).
The standards and samples were separated using a mobile phase consisting
of water/methanol (95:5, v/v) with 4 mM DBAA (eluent A) and water/acetonitrile
(25:75, v/v; eluent B). The mobile phase was 0% B initially, which
then increased to 80% over 8 min and then to 100% over 5 min. The
mobile phase was held at 100% B for 3 min and then reequilibrated
to 0% B and held for 5 min. The flow rate was 180 μL/min. A
diverter valve was employed to reduce the introduction of matrix components
in the spectrometer. The mass spectra were acquired using electrospray
ionization in positive-ion mode. Multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM)
of MS/MS was used for the specific detection of each analyte and its
stable isotope. The settings of the ESI source were as follows: 30
psi curtain gas, 3500 V ionization, 350 °C temperature, 30 psi
nebulizer gas, and 40 psi heating gas. The mass spectrometer was set
with a dwell time of 80 ms for the MRM-scan survey. The declustering
(DP), entrance (EP), collision-energy (CE), and collision-cell-exit
(CXP) potentials for each MRM transition of analytes and internal
standards are reported in Table 1.

AMP (transition
492/146), ATP (transition 652/146), acetyl-CoA (transition 812/305),
and malonyl-CoA (transition 857/305) were used as internal standards.

Optimization of Chromatographic
Conditions
Retention
times in ion-pairing chromatography were optimized by adjusting the
concentration of the ion-pairing reagent as previously described.14 We tested several concentrations of DBAA (1,
2, 4, 6, and 10 mM) in mobile phase A for optimal analyte separation
(Figure S1).

Calibration, Quantification,
and Validation
Stable-isotope-labeled
AMP, ATP, acetyl-CoA, and malonyl-CoA were used as internal standards
to control for extraction efficiency, MS response, variable LC retention
times, and ionization efficiency. Isotopically labeled ATP was used
to quantify ATP, ADP, NAD+, and ADPR (NADH), whereas isotopically
labeled malonyl-CoA was used to quantify malonyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA,
and propionyl-CoA (Table 1). Standards of ATP, ADP, AMP, NAD+, ADPR, short-chain
acyl-CoAs, and stable-isotope-labeled internal standards were accurately
weighed and dissolved in water to prepare stock solutions at 1.0 mg/mL.
Calibration curves were constructed in the range of 10 ng/mL to 50
μg/mL with a fixed amount of stock solutions. Values for the
slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient were obtained by linear-regression
analysis of the calibration curves constructed by plotting analyte/internal-standard
peak-area ratios versus concentrations (Table S1). The area under each analyte peak, relative to the internal
standard, was quantified using Analyst software 1.7 (AB SCIEX) and
used to calculate the analyte concentrations.

Method accuracy,
precision, and repeatability and sample stability and recovery were
determined in mouse liver tissue processed as described above with
200 μL aliquots distributed into microcentrifuge tubes and stored
at −80 °C. The accuracy of the method was evaluated by
recoveries of additional analyte added to liver-tissue samples. Stable-isotope-labeled
AMP, ATP, acetyl-CoA, and malonyl-CoA internal standards and known
amounts of analytes (0, 1.5, 4, and 6 μg in triplicate) were
added to tissue homogenates (Table S2).
Sample recovery is expressed as [(found amount – endogenous
amount)/spiked amount × 100%]. The precision of the method was
examined by triplicate analysis over 3 separate days (Table S3) and was estimated as the coefficient
of variation (CV, %) of the replicate intra- and interday measurements,
with a new standard curve each day. To assess extract stability, acidified
liver extracts were spun, pooled, neutralized, and divided into multiple
aliquots. One aliquot sample was analyzed immediately, whereas the
rest were stored at room temperature, 4 °C, or −20 °C
for 1, 4, 8, 19, or 28 days for subsequent analyses. Analyte stabilities
in stored samples were compared to extracts stored at −80 °C
prior to neutralization. The assay-stability profile was indicated
by the fold-change of each analyte relative to immediate analysis.

The biological responsiveness of the method was demonstrated using
liver tissue collected from overnight fasted male C57BL6J mice. Animal
protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Liver samples
were collected from isoflurane anesthetized mice in situ
either by dissecting and immediately freezing tissue (1 s) in liquid
N2 or by collecting ∼1 mL of blood from the descending
aorta (inducing hypovolemic ischemia) and then dissecting and freezing
the samples 27–270 s later. All samples were stored at −80
°C until analysis. Cellular energy charge was calculated as  

Results and Discussion
Detection of Nucleotides and CoAs by MS/MS
in Positive Mode
after Ion-Pairing Liquid Chromatography
Adenosine nucleotides
and short-chain acyl-CoAs have poor chromatographic retention under
conventional reverse-phase conditions but can be separated using various
ion-pairing reagents. Dibutylammonium acetate (DBAA) achieved better
chromatographic separation than TEA or DMHA, which gave poor peak
shapes for the analysis of nucleotides from liver extracts (Figure S2). As expected, the retention times
tended to increase with higher DBAA concentrations for all the analytes
(except for NAD+, Figure S1A). Ion-pairing reagents can negatively affect ESI-MS detection, so
we tested the effect of DBAA on the analysis of nucleotides and acyl-CoAs
(Figure S1B). Although most analytes were
only moderately affected, the ATP and ADP signals were significantly
reduced with increasing DBAA concentration. Hence, we chose 4 mM DBAA,
which was the lowest concentration that achieved good separation of
ADPR from other coelutants. Methanol and acetonitrile were tested
as mobile phase B. Acetonitrile was found to give better peak shapes
(Figure S1C–K) with a shallow gradient
and lower column back pressure.

To specifically evaluate the
analysis of nucleotides and acyl-CoA species using DBBA as an ion-pairing
reagent, we performed MS detection in both negative- and positive-ion
modes (Figure 2). The
use of negative-ion-mode ESI-MS is a logical approach for adenosine
nucleotide detection because of the presence of up to three negatively
charged phosphate groups.14−16 Indeed, negative-ion full-scan
mode provided relatively simple spectra with [M – H]− as the most prominent ion among all analytes (Figure 2A). However, positive-ion ESI-MS is known
to have better sensitivity and an improved MS response compared with
negative-ion mode when ion-pairing reagents are present.28 Positive-ion ESI-MS has been successfully applied
to the analysis of nucleosides, nucleotides,28 and ribonucleotides.13 An important advantage
is that nucleotides form a unique and abundant product ion in positive-ion-mode
LC-MS/MS.17 Positive-ion-mode (Figure 2B), full-scan spectra
were more complex than negative-ion-mode spectra. The AMP molecular
ion [AMP + H]+ (m/z 348)
was ∼6 times higher than the [AMP + DBAA + H]+ (m/z 477) adduct ion. However, with increasing
numbers of negatively charged phosphate groups, such as in ADP, ADPR,
and ATP, the efficiency of adduct-ion formation ([M + DBAA + H]+) was greatly enhanced. This phenomenon was most striking
for ATP, which has three negatively charged phosphate groups and produced
[ATP + DBAA + H]+ exclusively. In contrast, full-scan,
positive-ion ESI-MS analysis of NAD+ produced mostly [NAD
+ H]+ (m/z 664) rather
than [NAD + DBAA + H]+. Short-chain acyl-CoAs produced
[M + DBAA + H]+ and [M + H]+ ions in near equal
amounts. Overall, the intensities of [M – H]− ions in negative-ion mode were generally stronger than those observed
for the [M + DBAA + H]+ ion in positive-ion mode, likely
because of the increased distribution of the total ion content in
the latter.14

Despite weaker signals
in positive-ion mode, the MS/MS product-ion
spectra were much stronger than those from negative-ion mode for all
analytes. For example, ADP, NAD+, and propionyl-CoA are
shown in Figure 2C,D.
No significant fragment ions were detected for NAD+ and
propionyl-CoA under negative-ion mode (Figure 2C). Under positive-ion mode, the major collision-induced
fragments of ADP at m/z 136 and
130 correspond to the fragmentation of the adenine base and DBA molecules,
respectively (Figure 2D). Because short-chain acyl-CoAs form both protonated and adduct
ions with similar intensity, MS/MS fragment species and their intensities
were monitored for both molecule ions, which were found to be similar
for all short-chain acyl-CoAs (data not shown). Short-chain acyl-CoAs
produced abundant fragments, as previously reported.27,29 The predominant MS/MS fragment was the acyl-pantetheine fragment,
derived by a neutral loss of 507. Other fragments observed were 428
(ADP), 136 (adenine), and 261 (pantetheine). A compilation of analytes
examined using this method, including the corresponding MS parameters,
are shown in Table 1. Because of significantly higher MS/MS responses in positive-ion
mode for the analytes, precursor ions and product ions were detected
in ESI positive-ion mode, and quantification was performed in MRM
mode. Detection of nucleotides and acyl-CoAs by ion-pairing LC-MS/MS
resulted in excellent linearity (r ≥ 0.9994)
for all analytes (Table S1). We noted nonunity
slopes for most analytes, indicating that individual calibration curves
should be generated. Analyte recoveries ranged from 83.7 to 112.0%,
and the CV of the method ranged from 0.5 to 13.9% (Table S2). The method had very good intra- and interday precision,
with a CV less than 15% for all analytes except malonyl-CoA, which
was 18.9% for the interday repeatability (Table S3).

Labile Nucleotide and Acyl-CoA Samples
Biological nucleotides
and CoAs are inherently reactive and must be stored at low temperatures
to minimize sample degradation.30 Nearly
all analytes degraded (>20%) when neutralized extracts were stored
at room temperature for a single day (Figure S3). Nucleotides were protected for several days at 4 °C and several
weeks at ≤−20 °C. CoAs were more labile than nucleotides
and degraded within days of storage at ≤−20 °C
or within 2 weeks when acidified extracts were stored at −80
°C (Figure S3). Fortunately, internal
stable-isotope standards provided some analytical protection against
analyte lability (Figure 3). Thus, nucleotides, acetyl-CoA, and malonyl-CoA (Figure 3A–G) could
be quantified for at least 28 days when stored at ≤−20
°C with internal standards. However, because stable-isotope-labeled
succinyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA were unavailable, even 1 day at −20
°C caused a 12% underestimation, and 4 days resulted in a 50%
underestimation of those analytes (Figure 3H,I). Presumably, the durability of succinyl-CoA
and propionyl-CoA analysis would be improved by use of their corresponding
stable-isotope-labeled internal standards. Nevertheless, all nucleotides
and short-chain acyl-CoAs, including succinyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA,
could be accurately quantified for 20 days when acidified liver extracts
were stored at −80 °C.

propionyl-CoA. All analytes could be accurately quantified for 20
days when acidified liver extracts were stored at −80 °C.

Accurate Determination
of Tissue Energy Status by Snap-Freezing
Tissue Samples
Although these analytes degrade in hours or
days in extracts, many have half-lives on the order of seconds in
tissue. As illustrated in Figure 4A, dramatic fluctuations in metabolites and cofactors
related to energy metabolism are caused by ischemia (low blood flow)
and hypoxia (low oxygen) during momentary delays between dissecting
and freezing tissue.31,32 Acute hypoxia inhibits ATP synthesis
and NADH oxidation in mitochondrial respiration. Rapid drops in ATP
and NAD+ and accumulation of ADP, AMP, and NADH stimulate
anaerobic glycolysis and rapidly inhibit acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA
formation. These conditions cause a reduced cellular redox state (NADH/NAD+) and accumulation of lactate, loss of pyruvate, and similar
shifts in redox pairs of the TCA cycle (Figure 4A). A 10 s delay between dissection and freezing
of liver tissue was sufficient to cause inaccurate measurements of
lactate, pyruvate, and TCA-cycle intermediates (Figure S4). In fact, alteration of respiration or blood flow
for any reason during tissue collection (anesthesia, oxygenation,
euthanasia in animal models by exanguination or cervical dislocation,
etc.) will cause similar shifts in metabolism with varying rapidity.
For example, the order of tissue collection also impacts metabolite
levels, particularly when there is significant blood loss. We dissected
liver tissue from mice either immediately or after various amount
of time (27–270 s) of hypovolemic ischemia (∼1 mL blood
collection). There was a significant decrease in ATP and a rise in
AMP, demonstrating a loss of energy charge in the tissue (Figure 4B), which dropped
exponentially following blood loss (Figure 4C). Although NAD+ was unchanged,
NADH increased, and the NAD+/NADH ratio declined (Figure 4D) confirming a reduced
cellular redox state during ischemia. Acyl-CoA concentrations
generally decreased, except for those of propionyl-CoA, which increased
(Figure 4E). These
data demonstrate that blood loss during tissue collection induces
rapid changes in metabolite levels, and suggests that it will be difficult
to obtain accurate metabolomic analyses on multiple-tissue dissections.
Hence, consideration should be given to prioritize the order of tissue
collection, and allow for independent cohorts when blood loss cannot
be avoided between organ collection (e.g., heart, liver, kidney, etc.).

Figure 4 (A) Effect
of hypoxia and ischemia on select metabolites and cofactors
related to energy metabolism. Oxygen deficiency inhibits respiration,
leading to an accumulation of NADH and lack of ATP. The resulting
decrease in NAD+/NADH inhibits the TCA cycle and fat oxidation,
decreases associated acyl-CoAs, and stimulates anaerobic glycolysis.

Conclusions
An HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method was developed
for simultaneous determination
of nucleotides and short-chain acyl-CoAs in liver tissue. Using ion-pairing
LC-MS/MS, reasonable retention times and resolutions for the analytes
were achieved. To ensure high specificity, quantification was performed
in MRM mode with stable isotopes as internal standards. The method
was applied to the simultaneous determination of ATP, ADP, AMP, NAD+, NADH, acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and succinyl-CoA
in mouse liver tissue. The method is likely generalizable to other
analytes in these classes of metabolites. For example, during revision
of this article, we found that the method could be used to detect
free CoA and GTP in liver extracts (Figure S5). The method detected hypoxia-induced changes in most analytes when
tissue was collected after blood loss. This finding is not unique
to the method and indicates that care should be taken in interpreting
metabolomic data when multiple organs are sampled.
