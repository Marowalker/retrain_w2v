A Structures
for Lossless Ion Manipulations (SLIM) module that
allows ion mobility separations and the switching of ions between
alternative drift paths is described. The SLIM switch component has
a “Tee” configuration and allows the efficient switching
of ions between a linear path and a 90-degree bend. By controlling
switching times, ions can be efficiently directed to an alternative
channel as a function of their mobilities. In the initial evaluation
the switch is used in a static mode and shown compatible with high
performance ion mobility separations at 4 Torr. In the dynamic mode,
we show that mobility-selected ions can be switched into the alternative
channel, and that various ion species can be independently selected
based on their mobilities for time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF
MS) IMS detection and mass analysis. This development also provides
the basis of, for example, the selection of specific mobilities for
storage and accumulation, and the key component of modules for the
assembly of SLIM devices enabling much more complex sequences of ion
manipulations.

==== Body
Ion mobility spectrometry/mass
spectrometry (IMS/MS) is a technique that separates ions based on
their size-to-charge and mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios, respectively.1 IMS/MS
has been applied for ion separations of compounds from complex mixtures,2 including, for example, peptides,3 proteins,4 lipids,5 carbohydrates,6 and
tissue samples.7 IMS/MS has also been applied
to the separation of structural isomers,8 for example, protein conformers.9 There
are several types of IMS instruments widely used for biomolecular
analysis, including low-field drift tube IMS10,11 and high-field asymmetric ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS).12 Low-field drift tube instruments operate by
allowing ions to traverse through the drift tube by means of DC potentials
in the presence of a buffer gas, with drift motion governed by diffusion.
Ions are introduced by gated pulses, conventionally via a Bradbury–Nielsen
gate,13 into the drift tube to establish
an initial time to separate ions by their drift times. More recently,
for greater ion duty cycle and sensitivity, gating14 and trapping15 (as well as ion
accumulation) in ion funnels have been employed to pulse ions into
the IMS. Additionally, ion utilization efficiency from continuous
ion sources can be increased by multiplexing ion pulsing events.16−18 Ion mobilities (K) can be directly measured for
each ion from drift tube IMS by the following equation  where L is the drift tube
length, td is the ion drift time, and E is the electric field across the drift tube. Collisional
cross sections of ions can be calculated by the Mason equation19  where N is the
number density
of the buffer gas, μ is reduced mass of the ion and buffer gas, T is temperature, and Ω is the measured collisional
cross section. Measured cross sections can be compared to theoretical
cross section approximations20,21 or experimentally determined
NMR or X-ray diffraction structures to gain insight into gas-phase
3-D structural information.22

The
mobility selection of ions has been previously achieved using
FAIMS,23 differential mobility analyzers
(DMA),24 overtone mobility spectrometry
(OMS),25 and double gated low field drift
tube IMS26 devices for applications. FAIMS
utilizes the differences in mobilities at high versus low electric
fields by applying a high electric field for a short time and a low
electric field for a comparatively longer time, such that the times
the fields are applied are asymmetric. Ions eventually collide with
the electrodes unless a compensation voltage (CV) is used to select
a specific high field to low field mobility ratio to pass through
the device. By scanning the CV, an ion mobility spectrum can be obtained,
but with either very low resolving power or very low transmission
efficiency (and hence significantly reduced sensitivity).27 In DMA charged particles, especially aerosols
or nanoparticles, travel in a gas flow perpendicular to the ion drift
motion between two plates with a potential applied between the two
plates. Mobility selection occurs by scanning the applied potential
such that ions of specific mobilities pass through a slit to a particle
counter, where the ions are dispersed in space by size, but provides
sensitivities constrained by the limited size of the both the entrance
and sampling slits if reasonable resolutions are to be achieved, as
well as low transmission efficiency because of loss of ions with mobilities
other than the mobility selected by the applied potential. The overtone
mobility approach uses an arrangement that is similar to conventional
drift tube instruments, but is operated by changing the electric fields
in specific drift regions at a certain frequency that selects a small
range of mobilities that can travel through the device. Ions also
have stable trajectories at the overtones of the selected frequencies,
with increasing resolving power for the higher order overtones. Finally,
ions can be selected in a low electric field drift tube using an ion
gate after the drift tube, allowing only ions selected by their mobilities
(i.e., during the gate “open” period) to pass to the
detector. While this approach does not impact sensitivity, information
for the rest of the separation is lost.

Recently, structures
for lossless ion manipulations (SLIM) have
been introduced and characterized with both simulations and measurements,
and shown to provide the basis for effectively lossless ion transmission,
for example, at 4 Torr and over a significant m/z range.28−30 IMS separations in SLIM have been shown to achieve
near theoretical limits of resolving power.30,31 A key interest with SLIM is the assembly of simple components, initially
being constructed from 7.62 × 7.62 cm printed circuit boards,
into more complex modules that enable a range of functionalities,
and then can be assembled into even more complex devices. The initial
devices have been shown to efficiently transmits ions of mass <180
to >2700 m/z.29,30 Key SLIM components include straight and 90° turning ion drift
segments that, for example, can be assembled into IMS modules by different
arrangements of the individual components. In this work, the dynamic
ion switch component is introduced. The ion switch can be operated
in modes that either selects ions by their mobilities for direction
to an orthogonal channel as they arrive in the switching region (dynamic
mode) or to allow all ions to pass for continued drift in a linear
channel (static mode). By coupling the ion switch with other SLIM
components, a low field drift IMS module has been constructed with
the ability to select ions by mobility, allowing new flexibility for
IMS/MS applications.

Experimental Arrangement
ESI-SLIM/MS
Agilent
Low Concentration Tuning Mix (Agilent,
Santa Clara, CA) and a mixture of 9 peptides infused at a flow rate
of 300 nL/min to the ESI source were used to demonstrate the capabilities
of the SLIM ion switch component and its respective IMS module. The
9 peptide mix was an equimolar mixture of 1 μM of each bradykinin
acetate salt, kemptide acetate salt, angiotensin I human acetate salt
hydrate, angiotensin II human, neurotensin, renin substrate tetradecapeptide
porcine, substance P acetate salt hydrate, melittin from honey bee
venom, and fibrinopeptide A human (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
The mixture solvent was composed of 50/50/1 vol/vol/vol water/methanol/acetic
acid (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The TOF MS system, and its
modifications for SLIM evaluation as used in this study has been described
in detail elsewhere (Figure 1).30 Briefly, ions are introduced from a nanoelectrospray
(2300 V) source into an ion funnel trap15,32 (3.95 Torr)
where ions are stored and gated for 486 μs into the SLIM. The
SLIM module (at 4.00 Torr) was comprised of one 3.05 cm linear, three
7.62 cm linear, a switch, and two additional 7.62 cm linear components
positioned such that ions were switched orthogonally to their original
path (Figure 1). Each component comprises two
SLIM surfaces spaced ∼5 mm apart in this work. Each SLIM component
PCB incorporates a central array of “rung” RF electrodes
operated 180° out of phase with each neighboring electrode. The
rungs are bordered on either side by DC-only “guard”
electrodes that provide lateral ion confinement. Ions exiting the
SLIM module are efficiently transmitted by a rear ion funnel to a
region containing a short quadrupole at 475 mTorr for transmission
to an Agilent 6224 TOF MS with a 1.5 m flight tube (Agilent, Santa
Clara, CA). In this work the SLIM module was operated with an axial
14 V/cm DC uniform drift field with an 11 V DC guard bias (Figure 2) and a 650 kHz, 320 Vp–p RF waveform
was applied for all experiments.

Figure 1 Schematic of SLIM/TOF MS arrangement used
in this work, including
the SLIM ion switch component. Ions must be switched 90° from
their original drift trajectory to be detected by the TOF MS.

SLIM Dynamic Switch Operation
The electrode configuration
for the dynamic ion switch component is shown in Figure 2. Ions drift from the ion funnel trap to the switch where
they either (i) continue on a straight path (switch off) or (ii) switched
to an orthogonal path (switch on) for TOF MS detection. The switching
guard electrode denoted in Figure 2 was independently
controlled so that its DC voltage could be raised to switch ions to
the orthogonal path or lowered to allow ions to continue along the
straight path. The DC voltage on the switching rung in the orthogonal
ion path was also switched to a higher potential to confine ions for
continued travel in the straight path, or to a lower potential to
switch ions into the orthogonal path. The switching of these two electrodes
was synchronized. The switching rung was the first electrode of the
DC gradient along the orthogonal ion path. Adjusting the switching
rung voltage did not affect any voltages on the rung electrodes of
the original straight path, but did affect the voltages in the orthogonal
path. When the switch was turned on, the switching rung was biased
such that an average 14 V/cm gradient is maintained along the entire
orthogonal path. The voltage on the switching guard was set to 543
V to allow ions to travel through the straight path, while the switch
is off. The switching rung was biased 10 V DC lower than the switching
guard voltage to prevent ion loss in the orthogonal direction. The
switching guard electrode was raised an additional 100 to 643 V and
the switching rung was lowered by 5 V DC to 528 V to turn the switch
on. Ion trajectory simulations showed this voltage profile yields
lossless ion transmission in either of the two directions.29 These voltages were controlled by power supplies
triggered by the opening of the exit ion gate in the ion funnel trap,
where time delays and pulse widths can be controlled using in-house
developed instrument control software. Rise times for the switching
guard voltage were measured to be on the order of ∼140 μs,
allowing for mobility-resolved ion selection.

guard electrodes on the dynamic ion switch
component. The switching guard voltage is raised by 100 V to direct
the ions orthogonal to their original drift path.

Results and Discussion
Demonstration of IMS and Mobility-Resolved
Ion Selection
To initially evaluate the capabilities of the
SLIM dynamic ion switch
component, ions were transferred through the SLIM module in static
and dynamic switching modes. In static mode, the necessary voltages
to move ions into the orthogonal path (+100 V bias on the switching
guard, DC bias of switching rung lowered 5 V) are constantly applied.
This mode allows for the collection of conventional drift IMS/MS spectra
(Figure 3a) similar to the 90° turn investigated
in previous work.29,30 Dynamic mode switching was used
to select individual ion species by their mobilities and switch them
into the orthogonal path to the MS (Figure 3b–d). Ions that were not switched (or selected) continued
to move in the straight path. In the dynamic mode, the switch was
on only for 0.81 ms. For Figure 3b, the switch
was turned on from the time period of 10.50 to 11.31 ms after the
ions were released from the ion funnel trap (i.e., t0). Only ions from the first IMS peak (m/z 622) were switched to the mass spectrometer in
this 0.81 ms switch on pulse. The ion clouds for m/z 922 and 1222 were not observed, as they reached
the switch after it had been turned off. The dynamic switching sequence
was repeated for m/z 922 (Figure 3c), with the switch on from 13.30 to 14.11 ms after t0, and for m/z 1222 (Figure 3d), from 16.25 to 17.06 ms
after t0. All three selected IMS/MS spectra
(Figure 3b–3d)
show only the specific peak that was chosen without cross contamination
from peaks of other mobilities.

Selection of IMS Features from a Peptide Mixture
The
dynamic ion switch was used to select specific mobility features from
the IMS spectrum of the 9 peptide mix. The switch was operated in
static mode to obtain the complete IMS spectrum (Figure 4a). The resulting IMS spectrum shows that there are at least
3 features in the IMS spectrum, including features with arrival times
of 17.24, 19.09, 20.75 ms (the shoulder on 19.09 ms). Peaks with IMS
arrival times within the first feature were switched in Figure 4b by switching from 7.00 to 8.00 ms after t0. The resulting ions were m/z 387 (kemptide, [M + 2H]2+) and 433
(angiotensin I, [M + 3H]3+), which both have arrival times
within the first IMS feature. The second and third features are no
longer present in the IMS/MS spectrum. Ions in the second IMS feature
were selected by switching ions arriving at the switch from 8.00 to
9.00 ms after t0. The observed peptide ions in this case
were m/z 524 (angiotensin II [M
+ 2H]2+), 531 (bradykinin [M + 2H]2+), 558 (neurotensin
[M + 3H]3+), and 587 (renin substrate tetradecapeptide
[M + 3H]3+), also including the tails of m/z 433 and 712 (melittin [M + 4H]4+)
IMS peaks. Each of the peptide ions switched are within the bounds
of the second IMS feature in Figure 4a, while
the two peaks that tail into the IMS spectrum in Figure 4c can be seen to be tailing into the second IMS feature in
the full spectrum (Figure 4a). The switching
experiment was performed again for 9.00–10.00 ms after t0 (Figure 4d), switching
peptide ions at m/z 675 (substance
P [M + 2H]2+), 712, and 769 (fibrinopeptide A [M + 2H]2+), as well as the shoulders of peptide ions m/z 587 and 649 (angiotensin I [M + 2H]2+). Again, the peptide ions appear within the selected mobility feature
in Figure 4a as well, and m/z 587 and 649 are tailing into the third mobility
feature, resulting in this population of ions being switched to the
mass spectrometer.

Though each of the previous cases shows selection
of a single mobility window at a time, there is no inherent restriction
to operating the switch in this fashion. The dynamic ion switch allows
for mobility ion selection of multiple mobility windows (Figure 5). The 9 peptide mix ions were switched from 7.00
to 7.50 ms (IMS peak at arrival time 16.98 ms) and 9.50 to 10.00 ms
(IMS peak at arrival time 21.57 ms). Again, the peaks that overlap
these regions in Figure 4a are the peaks that
were switched; however, both regions are switched within a single
IMS experiment.

Conclusion
A SLIM dynamic ion switch component has
been demonstrated to provide
ion transmission through an orthogonal path and to provide ion selection
based upon mobility. The dynamic ion switch allows for mobility selection
in conjunction with field drift ion mobility separations. It has previously
been shown that SLIM IMS performance is close to theoretical and with
results obtained from conventional drift tube designs. In this work
we have shown that high quality IMS/MS performance can also obtained
with the switch in static mode, and also in conjunction with ion selection,
that is, using the switch in a dynamic (mobility-resolved) mode. Specific
mobilities can be selected if there is sufficient IMS separation prior
to the switch segment, as demonstrated by selective isolation of m/z 622, 922, and 1222 ions from a simple
mixture. In addition, the ability to select mobility features from
a mixture of peptides and select multiple mobility windows in a single
mobility separation was demonstrated. The development and demonstration
of the SLIM ion switch component and the simple IMS module provides
a foundation for the assembly of much more complex SLIM modules or
devices that, for example, switch ions into storage and accumulation
trapping or reaction regions, and after which further mobility separations
can be conducted. The present work also demonstrates the key components
that will be required for the assembly of a multipass “mobility
cyclotron” module with the potential to enable extremely high
resolving power separations.33,34

The SLIM switch
component offers many advantages over existing
ion selection technology. The ion switch can be physically implemented
multiple times within a single SLIM module or device, owing to its
small size and flexibility. For the OMS and gated drift cell approaches,
this is much more difficult due to the resulting size and cost of
such a hypothetical instrument. In addition, it is possible for the
ions that are not switched to continue on to a different path for
additional analysis and not be inherently lost as they are for the
OMS and dual gated drift cell approaches. The small size and flexibility
of coupling mobility selection capabilities to SLIM modules and devices
using the SLIM switch provides the basis for much more complicated
ion manipulations than using the currently available platforms.
