The
utility of biological nanopores for the development of sensors
has become a growing area of interest in analytical chemistry. Their
emerging use in chemical analysis is a result of several ideal characteristics.
First, they provide reproducible control over nanoscale pore sizes
with an atomic level of precision. Second, they are amenable to resistive-pulse
type measurement systems when embedded into an artificial lipid bilayer.
A single binding event causes a change in the flow of millions of
ions across the membrane per second that is readily measured as a
change in current with excellent signal-to-noise ratio. To date, ion
channel-based biosensors have been limited to well-behaved proteins.
Most demonstrations of using ion channels as sensors have been limited
to proteins that remain in the open, conducting state, unless occupied
by an analyte of interest. Furthermore, these proteins are nonspecific,
requiring chemical, biochemical, or genetic manipulations to impart
chemical specificity. Here, we report on the use of the pore-forming
abilities of heat shock cognate 70 (Hsc70) to quantify a specific
analyte. Hsc70 reconstitutes into phospholipid membranes and opens
to form multiple conductance states specifically in the presence of
ATP. We introduce the measurement of “charge flux” to
characterize the ATP-regulated multiconductance nature of Hsc70, which
enables sensitive quantification of ATP (100 μM–4 mM).
We believe that monitoring protein-induced charge flux across a bilayer
membrane represents a universal method for quantitatively monitoring
ion-channel activity. This measurement has the potential to broaden
the library of usable proteins in the development of nanopore-based
biosensors.

==== Body
The utilization
of the properties
of nanopores, both biological and solid state, represents a promising
strategy in the development of sensitive biosensors.1−5 Nanopore-based detection strategies have the ability to provide
reproducible and sensitive detection down to the single molecule level.1,2,4 The success of biological nanopore-based
sensors, including ion channels and transmembrane proteins, is afforded
by the reproducible nanoscale pore size that biology provides with
an atomic level of precision.5 Furthermore,
measuring the conductivity of these pores embedded in an insulating
lipid bilayer is readily adaptable to resistive-pulse type measurements
for quantitative detection.2,3 Using resistive pulse
methods, the utilization of transmembrane proteins has been reported
for the sensitive detection of analytes ranging from divalent metal
ions,6 small molecules,2−4 and large single
stranded polynucleotides.7 While not as
physically robust as their solid-state counterparts,1,5 several recent reports describe strategies to overcome the limitations
of using biological pores, including their susceptibility to pH, salt,
and temperature changes,5,8 and the fragility of
the lipid bilayer that supports the protein pore.2−5 As such, the use of biological
nanopores continues to show promise in the development of biosensors.

The majority of recent reports using biological nanopores for sensor
development have been limited to the use of a handful of well-characterized,
well-behaved, and relatively nonspecific protein channels. These channels
include α-hemolysin (αHL),1,9−11Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA),1,5 alamethicin,12 and a more recently studied
DNA-packaging nanomotor protein phi29.1,13 The nonspecific
protein channel αHL has dominated the literature in the past
decade and presently is the most-studied nanopore channel for small
molecule detection1,4,14 and
DNA sequencing.1,5,15 Work
with MspA and phi29 has been mostly limited to DNA sequencing.1,5,13 αHL has become an excellent
candidate for ion channel-based biosensors due to its efficient pore-forming
capability,9,11 robust structure,2,3 and amenability to chemical and biochemical engineering.2,6,8 The latter has led to sensors
for the detection of various analytes, such as divalent metal ions,2,4,6 organic molecules,2,4,16 explosive agents,17,18 enzyme complexes,19 cancer biomarker,20 nucleic acids,4,7,8,15 and proteins.4,21 Alamethicin has been modified for the detection of protein–ligand
interactions12 and poly(ethylene glycol)
polymers.22 Unlike the other listed examples,
alamethicin forms pores with multiple, discrete conductance states
based on the number of monomer peptides coming together to form a
pore in the lipid membrane.12,22−25 While mutagenesis and other bioengineering approaches improve the
specificity of biological nanopores like αHL, it still remains
difficult to achieve high chemical specificity. Biology, on the other
hand, provides a wealth of specific, ligand-gated transmembrane proteins.
As such, using specific protein channels could provide a means to
develop extremely specific sensors. However, examples of using ligand-gated
proteins in the development of biosensors are few. These include whole
cell-based sensors, serotonin-gated channels (5H3T), and the peptide
sequence LKLHL for sugar sensing.26 The
relatively few examples is likely due to the commercial availability,
the level of characterization, and the difficult data analysis of
the activity of the proteins outside the commonly used channels.

In this study, we present the use of heat shock cognate protein
that displays adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-regulated ion channel activity
for the specific and quantitative detection of ATP. Specifically,
we utilize the channel-like activity of the heat shock cognate protein
Hsc70. The ion channel activity of Hsc70 was first reported by Arispe
and De Maio who demonstrated that recombinant Hsc70 spontaneously
inserts into lipid bilayers and requires ATP for consistent channel
activity.27 While Hsc70 does form stable
ion conductance pathways, the protein fluctuates between six open
conductance states and the closed state. Furthermore, little quantitative
and qualitative information is known about the proteins’ ATP-dependent
interactions with lipids. We, thus, label this protein as “misbehaved”
or “unusual” in relation to the well-behaved and well-characterized
channels like αHL.1 To account for
this unusual activity, we develop a new quantitative method that allows
reproducible and quantitative analysis of ATP. In particular, we introduce
the quantity “charge flux” to suitably characterize
the ATP-regulated ion channel-like activity of Hsc70 and specifically
quantify ATP as the target analyte. We demonstrate the quantitative
relationship of the ion-channel activity of Hsc70 on ATP using a lipid
bilayer cup setup. We believe that this new methodology is a universal
strategy for monitoring ligand-gated channel activity and could potentially
open pathways to using virtually any protein channel in the development
of sensitive biological nanopore-based biosensors.

Materials and
Methods
Chemicals
4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), MgCl2, CaCl2, KCl, and ATP disodium
salt were all purchased from Sigma and used as received. HEPES buffer
(5.0 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 1.0 mM MgCl2, pH
= 7) was prepared by dissolving the appropriate amount of chemicals
in ultrapure water (Milli-Q ultrapure water purification system).
The phospholipids, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine
(POPE), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (POPS) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster,
AL) and were stored in a −20 °C freezer until use. Recombinant
Hsc70 (Stressgen) was used as received without further purification
and was kept at −80 °C.

Preparation of Hsc70 Proteoliposomes
Hsc70 proteoliposomes
were prepared following a method described by Arispe et al. with several
modifications.28 Liposomes were prepared
by sonicating a 1:1 ratio mixture of POPE/POPS dissolved in 10 mM
HEPES–1 M KCl buffer for 5 min. Recombinant Hsc70 (2.5 μM)
was then added to the liposome suspension (30 μL) followed by
sonication for an additional period of 3–5 min. A 5 μL
aliquot of the Hsc70 proteoliposome suspension was added to the cis
side of the bilayer chamber and stirred for ion-channel activity measurements
in instances when the “liposome method” was used for
protein incorporation (described in more detail below).

Formation of
Black Lipid Membranes
Black lipid membranes
(BLMs) were formed in a bilayer chamber/cup setup (Warner Instruments,
CT) using a painting method described previously.29,30 Briefly, the bilayer cup was primed with a lipid suspension containing
POPE/POPS (1:1) dissolved in n-decane (MD Biochemicals,
LLC). After evaporation of excess decane, each compartment of the
bilayer chamber was filled with a buffer solution comprising 200 mM
KCl, 5 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM CaCl2, pH = 7. A clean plastic gel-loading tip was then lightly dragged
across the bilayer cup orifice to paint a lipid bilayer over the micropore.
Successful bilayer formation was evaluated through continuous monitoring
of the ionic current during the painting procedure, which drops to
0 A upon the formation of a highly resistive bilayer. In addition,
the application of ±1 V to induce electrical breakdown of the
bilayer was used to test bilayer formation. After electrical breakdown,
the bilayer was repainted across the orifice and utilized in ion-channel
recordings.

Electrical Measurements and Data Analysis
Ion-channel
current recordings were collected using a Dagan Chem-Clamp low-noise
potentiostat (Minneapolis, MN) interfaced to a PC through an in-house
written data collection program using LabVIEW (National Instruments).
Ag/AgCl reference electrodes, prepared by oxidation of clean Ag wires
(0.5 mm) in a saturated solution of sodium hypochlorite, were immersed
into the ionic solutions on each side of the bilayer chamber. Current–time
(i–t) measurements were recorded
at a constant applied potential. In this paper, the compartment connected
to the working electrode is referred to as the cis side, whereas the
chamber housing the reference electrode is regarded as the trans side.
Hence, the voltages reported herein are always referenced to the Ag/AgCl
electrode positioned at the trans side, thus we are applying a potential
to the cis side with respect to the trans side (Supporting Information Scheme 1).

Data analysis was
performed following a previously reported technique with minor modifications.31 In brief, the current recordings were analyzed
through integration of the current–time traces per unit time
and area of the 150 μm-diameter pore in the bilayer cup. We
designate this quantity as the charge flux, JQ (pC s–1 cm–2), or the
average amount of charge passing through the lipid bilayer per unit
area per unit time. By default, an intact lipid bilayer allows no
charge flux across the membrane. In the charge flux analysis, at least
three (n = 3) 10–60 s of current recordings
were used to calculate charge flux with and all current measurements
were done in triplicate.

Results and Discussion
In this report,
we utilize the reported ion-channel activity of
the heat shock cognate protein, Hsc70.27 While the biological functions of this protein have been the subject
of rigorous studies, work performed by Kurucz et al., Welch et al.,
and Domanico et al. suggest that this protein can associate with,
or localize near, the cellular membrane.27,32−34 For this reason, it has been postulated that heat
shock proteins are capable of directly interacting with lipids leading
to their ability to assist in the translocation of proteins across
lipid membranes. In 1990, Alder et al. initially validated this assumption
by demonstrating that Hsp70 induced pores in lipid membranes at low
or neutral pH, which promoted leakage of calcein from liposomes.35 In addition, Alder et al. observed the induction
of conductance pathways from interactions of human Hsp70 and groEL
with artificial lipid bilayers.35 More
recently, Arispe and De Maio demonstrated that Hsp70, particularly
recombinant Hsc70, spontaneously inserts into lipid bilayers and forms
stable ion-conductance pathways in the presence of ATP.27,36 The channels display multiple stable conductance states and fluctuate
between open and closed states.27 It has
been proposed that ATP binding and hydrolysis causes a conformational
change in the protein to enable interactions with peptides to perform
chaperone functions and is hypothesized to cause a channel opening.27 By measuring the mean amplitude of unitary current
events, Arispe and De Maio demonstrate an average conductance for
Hsc70 and demonstrate that the channel exhibits slight cationic selectivity.
Furthermore, their report demonstrates a qualitative relationship
between channel-like activity and ATP through the use of current–time
traces. Here, we present a quantitative measure of the ATP-dependent
activity of Hsc70.

To quantitatively evaluate the ion-channel
activity of Hsc70, we
utilized a setup employing a Delrin cup with an orifice of 150-μm
in diameter (Supporting Information Scheme
1). We form an artificial lipid bilayer using the painting method
described above with a mixture of POPE and POPS (1:1). This mixture
was used by Arispe and De Maio as this lipid composition provides
stable lipid bilayers with the ideal fluidity and acidity for incorporation
of Hsc70.27,35,36 We demonstrate
two different methods for protein insertion into the lipid bilayer.
First, a “direct addition” method is achieved by directly
adding a specific amount of recombinant Hsc70 to the ionic solution
in the cis side of the bilayer chamber. Alternatively, we employed
a “liposome method” in which Hsc70 proteoliposomes were
first prepared through sonication of the phospholipids with Hsc70
and were then added to the cis side of the bilayer chamber. With both
insertion methods, we observe stable current baselines over the minutes
time scale, or lifetime of the bilayer membrane, and reproducible
charge flux values at fixed concentrations of protein. As such, we
assume the protein distribution is in equilibrium between the membrane
and the solution.

ATP-Dependent Ion-Channel Activity of Hsc70
Hsc70 exhibits
ATP-regulated ion-channel activity with multiple conductance states
in a lipid bilayer. Upon the addition of Hsc70 proteoliposomes to
the cis side of the bilayer chamber with high ATP concentration (4
mM), we immediately observed increases in the number of current fluctuations,
indicating the flux of ions across the lipid membrane (Figure 1, top). Upon further examination, the current–time
trace demonstrates multiple conductance states as previously reported,27 ranging from 30–600 pS. The multiconductance
nature of Hsc70 is postulated to be a result of the protein’s
ability to self-associate and form different order of oligomers in
the absence of peptide targets.27 Alternatively,
conformational fluctuations occurring within the protein channel is
a possible cause of the multiconductance nature of Hsc70. It should
be noted that in the current–time traces presented here, we
could not confirm that there is only a single protein in the lipid
membrane at any given time. As we demonstrate below, the observed
current fluctuations are dependent on the concentration of the Hsc70
present in solution. The larger conductance values observed could
thus be a result of multiple channels that are open simultaneously.
Nonetheless, as described below, holding the protein concentration
constant allows for quantitative measurements of ATP.

Figure 1 Hsc70 displays ATP-regulated
ion-channel activity with multiple
conductance states in a black lipid membrane. (Top) Ion-channel activity
is only observed when Hsc70 is in solution. Using a bilayer chamber
filled with symmetric concentrations of KCl solutions (200 mM) and
liposomes without Hsc70 under an applied potential of +50 mV exhibit
baseline current recordings. Addition of Hsc70 proteoliposomes with
high ATP concentration (4 mM) results in a significant increase in
the current fluctuations or ion conductance pathways. The expanded
current–time trace reveals multilevel current events, indicating
that the Hsc70 channel switches from closed to several open states
and/or vice versa. (Bottom) Integrating the current with respect to
time and area allows for quantitative determination of the ion-channel
activity of Hsc70.

Again, while it is clear
that Hsc70 creates ion conductance pathways
through the artificial lipid bilayer as previously reported,27 we cannot unequivocally state that the current
fluctuations we observe are a result of a single Hsc70 channel. To
account for this, we define a new quantitative parameter to describe
the activity of the Hsc70 channels. This parameter, termed charge
flux (JQ, pC s–1 cm–2), provides a quantitative measurement of the net
charge crossing the lipid bilayer per unit area and time. Area was
normalized using the area of the orifice in the Delrin cup (150 μm
in diameter). The actual area of the bilayer may vary from bilayer
to bilayer as the solvent annulus size may vary.29 These differences may introduce small errors in calculating
the absolute value of charge flux. We believe, however, that using
the aperture size is a reasonable approximation as we achieve reproducible,
quantitative charge flux values. In the charge flux analysis, we typically
integrate over 10–60 s of current recordings and perform all
current measurements and charge flux calculations in triplicate.

The quantitative evaluation of the charge flux (JQ) across the lipid bilayer membrane demonstrates that
flux is distinctly larger when Hsc70 is incorporated into the lipid
bilayer (Figure 1, bottom) and, as is described
below, there is a distinct dependence on ATP concentration. This observation,
combined with the current fluctuations, confirms that Hsc70 reconstitutes
as a stable, multiconductive ion channel across an artificial lipid
bilayer. As a control, we demonstrate that adding liposomes alone
to the cis chamber while varying the amounts of ATP results in no
appreciable current fluctuations, or charge flux, above baseline activity
(Figure 1).

Ion-Channel Activity is
Dependent on Protein Concentration
The ion-channel activity
of Hsc70, and thus charge flux, increases
with increasing protein concentration. To control the concentration
of protein in the cis chamber, Hsc70 was directly added to the ionic
solution with 2 mM ATP. As the concentration of Hsc70 increased, we
observed a notable increase in the frequency of current fluctuations
indicating an increase in the number of protein conductance pathways.
Consequently, with more protein in solution, and thus presumably more
reconstituted into the membrane, we observed higher charge flux (Figure 2). Of note, at higher protein concentrations (>30
nM) the bilayer stability diminished dramatically. Typically, bilayers
were stable for ∼3–5 min at higher protein concentrations
compared to ∼20–30 min at lower protein concentrations.
Because of this quantitative relationship between protein concentration
and charge flux, we kept the protein concentration constant at 30
nM in the experiments described throughout the remainder of the text.

Figure 2 Ion-channel
activity of Hsc70 increases with increasing protein
concentration. Varying amounts of Hsc70 are added directly to the
cis side of a bilayer chamber containing symmetric amounts of 200
mM KCl and 2 mM ATP. The ion channel response, expressed as charge
flux, increases monotonically with increasing concentration of Hsc70
at all applied potentials. Of note, the difference in charge flux
observed at +50 mV and +100 mV are not directly proportional to each
other, suggesting that the ion channel has a preference for some ions
(discussed in Figure 3).

Charge flux through the membrane also increases with increased
applied potential as expected (Figure 2). A
larger potential gradient induced by the higher applied potential
provides more driving force and thus greater flux of ions across the
Hsc70 pathways. The change in charge flux with increasingly higher
positive applied potentials, however, is not linear, suggesting that
the Hsc70 ion channel displays ion selective behavior (discussed in
more detail below).

Ion Selectivity of Hsc70 Channels
The Hsc70 ion channel
exhibits slight cation selectivity. We investigated the ion channel
activity of Hsc70 by measuring the charge flux at various potentials
ranging from −100 mV to +100 mV and various ATP concentrations
(Figure 3, top).
These experiments were performed using the direct addition method
at constant Hsc70 concentration (30 nM) in the cis chamber. Ion-channel
activity significantly increased with positive applied potentials
as demonstrated by the current–time traces. Characterization
of the charge flux as a function of applied potential (JQ–V plot) shows that charge flux
is higher at positive applied potentials (Figure 3, bottom). While the lines in Figure 3 are to guide the reader’s eye, this observation, similar
to the channel conductance measurements at various potentials observed
by Arispe and De Maio,27 implies that the
Hsc70 ion channel is cation selective.

Figure 3 Hsc70 ion channels exhibit
cation selectivity. (Top) Current–time
traces demonstrate that ion-channel activity increases when the applied
potential is positive cis to trans. (Bottom) Varying the applied potentials
from +100 mV to −100 mV at a constant ATP concentration (2
mM) generated larger current amplitudes (hence, larger charge flux)
at positive applied potentials. The intersection on the negative cis
voltage axis demonstrates that Hsc70 preferentially permitted the
passage of cations. Lines are drawn to guide the reader’s eye.

Our observation of cation selectivity
is in agreement with the
observation that the Hsc70 ion-channel activity is cation-selective.
A review of the literature demonstrates that Hsc70, in general, preferentially
interacts with hydrophobic peptides, with high specificity for basic
or positively charged residues, particularly lysine and arginine.37−41 Furthermore, it has been shown that positively charged potassium
ions significantly enhance the ATPase activity of Hsc70,27,42 whereas this monovalent cation is also required for the dissociation
of denatured proteins from DnaK,27,43 a member of
the Hsc70 chaperone family in bacteria.37,39,44,45 These previous observations
suggest that Hsc70 may have a preference for cations.

Hsc70 Ion-Channel
Activity is Quantitatively Dependent on ATP
The ion-channel
activity of Hsc70 displays linear dependence on
ATP concentrations. We initially employed the liposome method to study
the quantitative relationship of ion-channel response on ATP (Supporting Information Figure S1). Using this
insertion method, however, resulted in inconsistencies in the current
fluctuations, which we hypothesize is a result of liposome aggregation
presented by the proteoliposomes (Supporting Information Figure S2). This hypothesis is based on an earlier report that demonstrates
that Ca2+ ions play a vital role in affecting the ability
of Hsc70 to induce liposome aggregation and, thus, potentially with
the black lipid membrane.46 To eliminate
significant effects of liposome aggregation, we used the direct addition
method to obtain quantitative ATP-dependent information on the ion-channel
activity of Hsc70 (Supporting Information Figure S3). For these experiments, Hsc70 was directly added to the
cis chamber of the bilayer cup apparatus. The applied potential was
held constant at +100 mV. Ion channel activity was monitored while
varying the ATP concentration from 0 to 4 mM in the cis chamber (Figure 4, top). As a result, charge flux increased as the
concentration of ATP increased (Figure 4, bottom).
The current signals steadily increased from 0 to 4 mM, indicating
a quantitative relationship between the Hsc70 ion-channel activity
and the concentration of ATP. Again, small variations may occur from
differences in actual bilayer area leading to deviations in the charge
flux measurements. The protein channel was sensitive to micromolar
concentrations, where the lowest ATP concentration detected was 100
μM, as seen in the lower region of the titration curve (Figure 4, bottom).

Figure 4 Ion-channel activity of Hsc70 displays quantitative
dependence
on ATP. (Top) Titration with ATP is performed in a bilayer chamber
where the bilayer separates two symmetric buffer solutions of 200
mM KCl. Hsc70 is directly added to the side that did not contain ATP
(cis). A membrane potential of +100 mV is applied, and measurements
are taken as ATP concentration is increased from 0 to 4 mM. (Bottom)
The ATP titration curve, showing the charge flux generated across
the membrane, shows a quantitative relationship between the ion-channel
activity of Hsc70 and the concentration of ATP, where larger charge
fluxes are observed in the presence of increasing amounts of ATP (line
of best fit equation: f(x) = 8857.2
+ 1280.9, R = 0.939). Examination of the lower region
of the titration curve demonstrates ATP detection at the micromolar
range (100 μM).

As mentioned above, the quantitative relationship of the
ion-channel
activity on ATP can be postulated to be a result of conformational
changes occurring within the protein channel induced by interaction
with ATP,27 possibly leading to the quantitative
dependence of the ion-channel response of Hsc70 on ATP. Our findings
show compelling evidence that through charge flux analysis of the
multiconductive ion-channel activity of Hsc70, we can quantitatively
detect milli- and micromolar concentrations of ATP with appreciable
sensitivity, selectivity, and high specificity.

Ion-Channel
Activity is Specifically Regulated by ATP
ATP specifically
regulates the ion-channel activity of Hsc70. We
employed a closely related purine nucleoside triphosphate molecule,
GTP, as a competing substrate for the Hsc70 channel. To test the specificity
of Hsc70 ion-channel activity, the protein was directly added to the
cis chamber of the bilayer cup apparatus, followed by incremental
amounts of GTP and ATP in an alternating fashion. The current–time
traces show clear distinctions in the current fluctuations produced
by GTP and ATP (Figure 5, top). The charge
flux is higher when ATP is in solution and only shows appreciable
changes whenever the ATP concentration is altered and not when the
GTP concentration is changed (Figure 5, bottom).
These results imply that ATP specifically regulated the ion-channel
activity of Hsc70 and that GTP, despite its structural resemblance
with ATP, does not influence the ability of Hsc70 to form conductance
pathways. Through these experimental findings, we have therefore established
that the Hsc70 ion channel has specificity for ATP, which can be a
valuable characteristic when this protein pore is employed in ion-channel
based biosensors for the selective and specific quantification of
ATP.

Figure 5 Hsc70 ion-channel activity is specifically regulated by ATP. (Top)
A black lipid membrane is prepared using symmetric amounts of 200
mM KCl and subjected to a maintained electric potential of +100 mV.
Hsc70 is directly added to the cis side of the chamber, followed by
incremental amounts of GTP and ATP in an alternating fashion. (Bottom)
The bar graph shows distinct current responses of the Hsc70 channel
in the presence of GTP, ATP, or both. The charge flux values only
change with changes in ATP concentrations.

Conclusion
In this report, we presented the use of
charge flux analysis as
a method to quantitatively analyze ligand-gated ion channel activity.
As a proof of concept, we utilized the ATP-dependent pore-forming
capability of Hsc70 across a lipid bilayer. Previous reports indicated
that Hsc70 reconstitutes into lipid bilayers and opens to create multiple
conductance states that displays slight cation selectivity in the
presence of ATP.27 We demonstrated, for
the first time, the quantitative relationship of Hsc70 ion-channel
activity on ATP, through quantitative analysis of ATP-induced charge
flux produced by Hsc70 across a lipid bilayer. This new method of
quantifying the Hsc70 ion-channel activity through charge flux analysis
allowed sensitive detection of ATP in the micromolar range (100 μM
– 4 mM). Finally, when channel response was assessed in the
presence of both ATP and GTP, Hsc70 exhibits specific regulation by
ATP without showing significant response to GTP. These data demonstrate
that the channel-like activity of Hsc70 can be used to provide quantitative
information about ATP.

Overall, we compellingly demonstrate
that this charge flux quantification
method, using Hsc70 ion channel as the biosensing element, permits
sensitive, specific, and quantitative detection of ATP, and thus,
holds considerable potential for use in biological nanopore-based
sensing. A similar approach was reported by Mayer et al. for the characterization
of a modified multiconductive alamethicin channel as it binds to proteins.12 This channel exhibits well-characterized, relatively
long-lived discrete conductance states as a function of the number
of monomer units associated with forming the pore in contrast to the
unknown origin of the fluctuations observed with the Hsc70 protein.
The authors measure charge flux for a given time period to quantify
protein–protein interactions. The charge flux at each concentration
of analyte protein is normalized to the maximum charge flux observed
at high analyte concentration. This method, however, requires measuring
a maximum flux whereas our method does not require knowing a maximum
flux value. Nonetheless, the measurement of charge flux appears to
open the possibility of using essentially any protein channel in the
development of sensitive ion-channel based biosensors. The utility
of sensitive and selective protein channels provided by nature can
ultimately offer a new route for the development of extremely sensitive
sensors capable of functioning in complex biological matrixes.
