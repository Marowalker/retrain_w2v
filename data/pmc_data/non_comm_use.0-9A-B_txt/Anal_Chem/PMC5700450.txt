The
self-replicating properties of proteins into amyloid fibrils
is a common phenomenon and underlies a variety of neurodegenerative
diseases. Because propagation-active fibrils are chemically indistinguishable
from innocuous aggregates and monomeric precursors, their detection
requires measurements of their replicative capacity. Here we present
a digital amyloid quantitative assay (d-AQuA) with insulin as model
protein for the absolute quantification of single replicative units,
propagons. D-AQuA is a microfluidics-based technology that performs
miniaturized simultaneous propagon-induced amplification chain reactions
within hundreds to thousands of picoliter-sized droplets. At limiting
dilutions, the d-AQuA reactions follow a stochastic regime indicative
of the detection of single propagons. D-AQuA thus enables absolute
quantification of single propagons present in a given sample at very
low concentrations. The number of propagons quantified by d-AQuA was
similar to that of fibrillar insulin aggregates detected by atomic-force
microscopy and to an equivalent microplate-based assay, providing
independent evidence for the identity of insulin propagons with a
subset of morphologically defined protein aggregates. The sensitivity,
precision, and accuracy of d-AQuA enable it to be suitable for multiple
biotechnological and medical applications.

==== Body
Digital microfluidic
assays
have revolutionized quantitative biology, as they facilitate the precise
and accurate quantification of absolute numbers of biomolecules.1,2 The use of digital microfluidics offers the possibility of performing
a very large number of individual experiments in small droplet compartments
in a short time, yielding the data volumes needed for digital analysis.
Microfluidics therefore enables assays with higher throughput, greater
reliability, and sensitivity than conventional methods.1,3−5 The miniaturization to picoliter (pL)-sized droplets
further allows for an effective reduction in the consumption of rare
biological samples, costs, potential contamination, and surface effects
due to the absence of air–water interfaces.1−3 This concept
has already transformed several applications in DNA technology, including
the further development of the digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR)6,7 to droplet digital PCR (ddPCR),8−11 DNA microarrays,12,13 and next-generation sequencing,14 as
it enables large numbers of parallel experiments for absolute quantification
of specific targets even at low concentrations. Digital microfluidics
has also been applied to cell-based assays,15−17 protein biomarker
detection,18 isothermal amplification chemistry,19 studies on amyloid growth,20 and high-throughput applications.1 In this paper, we describe the extension of digital microfluidics
to amyloid amplification assays.

Amyloid amplification assays
have recently been developed to address
the urgent need for reliable and sensitive in vitro detection of amyloid
aggregates—which cause a range of neurodegenerative disorders,
including transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, Alzheimer’s,
Parkinson’s, and many other diseases21−23—for
basic research and for diagnostic applications.24−27 These diseases are associated
with the ability of proteins to self-assemble into amyloid fibrils
in a nucleation-dependent polymerization reaction.28,29 This process typically follows a sigmoidal kinetic progression involving
primary nucleation, aggregate growth and fibril elongation, along
with secondary processes, such as fragmentation and surface-induced
nucleation events that serve to amplify the number of aggregates.30,31 The process of amyloid formation therefore involves the generation
of “propagons”,32 defined
as all those aggregated species, including fibrils, that are able
to seed or propagate the conversion of monomeric proteins into a higher
number of active propagons in a template-catalyzed way.

Amyloid
amplification assays are built on the self-propagation
principle, promoting the amplification of minute amounts of active
pathological species to readily detectable levels in the presence
of their monomeric counterparts. Assays that use either cyclic sonication
for efficient amplification, as in the protein misfolding cyclic amplification
(PMCA) assay,24 or agitation in a microplate,
as in the real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay,25 have been developed for sensitive detection
of prions and prionoids33 in biological
samples.26,27,34 These assays,
however, have certain limitations with respect to automation and high-throughput
applications and are, because of their analogue nature, able to measure
only average concentrations. Digital microfluidics can potentially
overcome these limitations, because of its ability to perform high
numbers of pL-sized volume reactions, allowing the precise quantification
of absolute numbers of single low-abundance entities present in a
system.

Here, we describe the development of a digital amyloid
quantitative
assay, d-AQuA, using droplet-based microfluidics. We demonstrate that
d-AQuA represents a powerful method for the ultrasensitive detection
of single insulin propagons contained in a sample and their absolute
quantification. D-AQuA also showed a significantly better performance
with respect to sensitivity, precision, and speed than an equivalent
assay in a microplate. We therefore anticipate that d-AQuA holds great
potential for advancing a wide range of biotechnological and medical
research applications and opens up new avenues for ultrasensitive
and precise high-throughput digital diagnostics.

Experimental Section
Materials
Human insulin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(SAFC Biosciences) and used without further purification. All chemicals
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise specified.

Standard
Fibril Sample Preparation
Fibrils were assembled
in vitro by incubating 1 mM monomeric human insulin in a 10 mM HCl
water solution at pH 2.0 (HCl, pH 2.0) at 65 °C and agitation
at 600 rpm for 72 h. Residual monomeric species were removed by intense
washing with HCl (pH 2.0) using Amicon centrifugal filters (MWCO 100
kDa; Merck Millipore).35 Fibrils were lyophilized
and stored at −20 °C until usage. The sample was diluted
to a concentration of 400 μM (monomer equivalents) to yield
the standard fibril sample.

Standard Fibril Sample Characterization
The standard
fibril sample was characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM),
dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR), far-UV circular dichroism (CD), and a self-propagation activity
assay. The details are described in SI Materials
and Methods.

Microdroplet Device Fabrication
Microfluidic flow-focusing
devices (Figure S1) were fabricated using
standard soft-lithography techniques.36 Briefly, the device design was patterned on a silicon wafer using
SU-8 negative photoresist (MicroChem) to produce a negative mold.
Microfluidic channels were cast into poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS;
Dow Corning Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer) on the silicon mold, and
the PDMS stamp was cured at 65 °C for 150 min before peeling
off the mold. Channel inlets and outlets were punched into the PDMS
stamp before oxygen plasma bonding it to a glass slide to seal the
channels. To make channel walls hydrophobic, the device was flushed
with the water repellent agent Aquapel (PPG Industries) for 30 min
before washing with isopropanol and then blow-drying with a nitrogen
stream.

D-AQuA Assay
Lyophilized insulin was dissolved in HCl
(pH 2.0) at a concentration of 6 mg mL–1 and filtered
(50 kDa Amicon centrifugal filters; Millipore UFC505096) to remove
higher-molecular-weight species. The protein was dissolved to a final
assay concentration of 400 μM in HCl (pH 2.0) containing 0.1
M GdmCl and 40 μM Thioflavin (ThT). Serial 10-fold dilutions
of the standard fibril sample were prepared in HCl (pH 2.0) and added
to the reaction mixture immediately before encapsulating the mixture
into microdroplets. Negative controls were incubated with the same
volume of HCl (pH 2.0) instead of fibrils. Amplification reactions
were encapsulated into water-in-oil-emulsions using a microfluidic
device with flow focusing geometry. The sample containing monomeric
substrate, fibrils, and ThT was injected into the middle inlet on
the chip at a flow rate of 200 μL h–1. The
carrier oil phase made of fluorinated FC-40 (Sigma) with 4% (w/v)
triblock copolymer (ABA) surfactant (where A is a perfluorinated poly(propylene
oxide) block and B a poly(ethylene oxide) block, synthesized as previously
described37) was injected into the outer
inlet at a flow rate of 300 μL h–1 to generate
droplets with a radius of ∼25 μm (volume ∼65 pL).
Fluid flow rates were controlled with a Cetoni neMESYS syringe pump
(Cetoni GmbH). Between 500 and 1400 replicate droplets were collected
per dilution at the outlet into Rectangular Borosilicate capillaries
(CM Scientific), and the capillaries were sealed with wax plugs to
prevent sample evaporation. Before imaging the capillaries containing
samples at different fibril dilutions, capillaries were aligned on
a glass slide for amplification and imaging. The aligned capillaries
were placed on the automated motorized stage of a custom-built epifluorescence
laser microscope (Figure S1) and covered
with a hot plate heated to 65 °C to induce amplification. To
track aggregate formation within the droplets, fluorescent images
were acquired every 15 min for approximately 24 h using laser excitation
at 445 nm (diode laser (MLD445, Cobolt)). Individual droplets were
identified manually, and the average intensity of the droplet area
was extracted for all frames. The brightness of the images of the
102 capillary in Figure 3a was adjusted to account for minor differences in
brightness arising from imaging on different frames of the automated-stage
laser (for original figure, see Figure S4). Fluorescent traces in Figure 3b were considered complete, once the plateau region
was obtained.

Microplate Amyloid Amplification Assay
Lyophilized
insulin was dissolved in HCOOH (pH 3.0) at a concentration of 6 mg
mL–1 and filtered using 50 kDa Amicon Ultra centrifugal
filters (Millipore, prod. no. UFC505096). The protein was dissolved
to a final concentration of 2 μM in 0.75 M D-mannitol, 1 M GdmCl,
10 μM ThT, HCOOH (pH 3.0) in a reaction volume of 28.5 μL
per well. To each reaction, either 1.5 μL of serial 10-fold
dilutions from 104 to 1015 of the standard fibril
sample (dissolved in HCOOH, pH 3.0) or HCOOH (pH 3.0, negative control)
was added. Each dilution and the control were performed in 16 technical
replica on black 384-well polystyrene microplates (Corning, prod.
no. 3540) covered with sealing tape (Sarstedt, prod. no. 95.1999).
Microplates were incubated at a constant temperature of 30 °C
with cyclic agitation (1 min at 300 rpm followed by 2 min quiescent)
on a SpectraMax Paradigm microplate reader (Molecular Devices). To
monitor the aggregation kinetics, ThT fluorescence was measured at
482 nm following excitation at 440 nm every 3 min from the bottom
of the microplate. The error of the assay was calculated from three
independent replicate measurements of the microplate assay (for data
analysis see section Digital Data Analysis). The replicate measurements are shown in Figure 5 and Figure S3.

Digital Data Analysis
To digitize the assay readout
for absolute propagon quantification, fluorescence end point values
of the amplification reactions were transformed into positive and
negative signals by thresholding. For the microplate assay, the threshold
was set five standard deviations above the mean of the unseeded negative
control reactions (x̅0 + 5σ0), and any signal above the threshold was regarded as a positive
signal. For d-AQuA, droplets which showed positive ThT fluorescence
at the end point were scored positive. The fraction of positive droplets
at every dilution was then calculated from the number of positive
droplets and the total number of droplets counted in the corresponding
brightfield images. The absolute number of propagons in both assays
was calculated using the Possion distribution model. The probability
of finding k propagons in a reaction compartment,
if the average number of propagons per reaction compartment is λ,
is described by the Poisson distribution 1  The probability of having one or more propagons
per reaction compartment (the probability of a positive signal) is
given by 2  where P(X = 0) is
the probability of not having any propagons in the reaction
compartment (the probability of a negative signal). For the different
dilution factors d, the probability of having one
or more propagons per compartment can be described as 3  where λ
is the average number of propagons
in the original sample and d is the dilution factor.
The fraction of positive signals can be related to the dilution factors
using eq 3, and therefore,
the absolute number of propagons in the original sample λ can
be calculated. All data analysis was carried out using Matlab (The
MathWorks, U.S.A.).

Fibril Quantification by AFM
The
number of fibrils
per unit volume of the standard fibril sample was estimated from AFM
length distribution and mass conservation. The distribution of fibrils Ni(L) as a
function of the contour length measured by AFM is shown in Figure 4b. This distribution
is essentially the same distribution of fibrils per unit volume, differing
by a mere normalization constant α, so that the distribution
of fibrils per unit volume is simply αNi(L). The constant α
can be obtained from the total mass per unit volume, which is obtained
from the initial molar concentration of monomer cm, i.e. cmMW. Therefore, by mass conservation
this results in 4  where ρ is the density
of the monomer
and the fibril, that are assumed here to be identical. This then gives
α = cmMW/(∑Ni(L)·Liπr2ρ), since all the terms on the
right-hand are known.

The total number of fibrils per unit volume, , is then 5  where both ∑Ni(L)·Li and ∑Ni(L) are known from the distribution
of fibrils as a function of the contour length in Figure 4b.

Results and Discussion
Workflow
of d-AQuA
The setup of d-AQuA is schematically
depicted in Figure 1. We used a microfluidic chip with flow focusing geometry to generate
uniform droplet compartments for highly parallel amplification of
single propagons in thousands of pL-droplets. This high number of
parallel measurements enables a digital interpretation of the data
for precise and accurate quantification of the absolute number of
propagons contained in a sample. Individual droplets encapsulating
the soluble substrate protein, Thioflavin T (ThT), a fluorescent dye
that allows specific detection of amyloid aggregates, along with a
series of 10-fold dilutions of a propagon-containing sample, are formed
from water-in-oil emulsions at kilohertz frequency. Droplets of each
fibril dilution are stored inside glass capillaries, and amplification
is carried out in the individual droplets to the end-point. Droplets
containing amplified aggregates induced by propagons are detected
by their positive ThT fluorescence signals, and the number of fluorescence
positive and negative droplets is counted. As d-AQuA enters a stochastic
regime at limiting dilutions, the Poisson distribution model becomes
valid and is applied for determining the absolute number of propagons
in the original sample.

droplets are counted, and the absolute number of propagons in the

Standard Fibril Sample
Generation
For the development
of d-AQuA, we used the hormone insulin as a model system, because
it readily forms amyloid fibrils analogous to those of disease relevant
amyloidogenic proteins,38 and is therefore
widely used as experimental model protein to study amyloid formation.39−41 We first generated a standard fibril sample, a well-characterized
sample of preformed insulin fibrils with reproducible propagation
properties. Insulin fibrils were reconstituted in vitro by incubating
human insulin at a concentration of 1 mM in HCl (pH 2.0) at 65 °C
and agitation at 600 rpm for 72 h. Residual monomeric species were
removed by intense washing with 1 mM HCl (pH 2.0) using Amicon centrifugal
filters (MWCO 100 kDa).35 The remaining
fibrils were lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. The fibrils
were diluted to a concentration of 400 μM (monomer equivalents)
to yield the standard fibril sample. We analyzed this sample for the
typical morphological and biophysical characteristics of amyloid fibrils
and its self-propagation activity in a seeded propagation assay (Figure 2). Dynamic light
scattering (DLS) measurements showed that the fibrils have a mean
hydrodynamic radius of 85 nm (Figure 2a). Furthermore, both Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
and circular dichroism (CD) spectra indicated a high β-sheet
content, which is characteristic of amyloid fibrils40,42 (Figure 2b,c). To
assess the propagation activity of the sample, the kinetics of fibril
formation by monomeric insulin in the presence of preformed fibrils
from the standard sample were monitored by optical density at OD370 nm (Figure 2d). Increasing concentrations of preformed fibrils (1, 2,
and 5% of total protein concentration) were found to shorten the lag
phase of the aggregation reaction gradually, as expected for a nucleated
self-assembly process. These results indicate that the standard fibril
sample exhibits the typical biophysical characteristics of amyloid
fibrils.

Figure 2 The standard fibril sample was characterized by DLS (a), FTIR spectroscopy
(b, shown are the whole spectrum as a solid line and its deconvoluted
peaks as dashed lines), far-UV CD spectroscopy (c) and a self-propagation
activity assay (d).

Development of d-AQuA
Next, we established the experimental
conditions for d-AQuA (Figure 1; experimental setup in Figure S1). Initially, 400 μM insulin in HCl (pH 2.0), 0.1 M guanidinium
chloride (GdmCl), and 40 μM ThT were encapsulated inside microdroplets
together with serial 10-fold dilutions ranging from 102 to 108 of the standard fibril sample (in monomer equivalents).
We found that the use of a high concentration of the substrate and
the addition of low amounts of GdmCl which accelerates aggregation
by inducing partial unfolding of the monomeric species,43 were important for efficient amplification.
Droplets without (i.e., unseeded controls) and with different dilutions
of preformed fibrils were collected in separate capillaries, mounted
on a microscope slide and heated to 65 °C to accelerate the growth
and proliferation of the propagons. Fluorescence images were taken
every 15 min to follow the amplification process in the individual
droplets over 24 h (Figure 3a,b). For the absolute quantification of
the number of propagons, we analyzed between 500 and 1400 droplets
per dilution and digitized the readout by grouping the fluorescence
end point signals into positive and negative outcomes by thresholding
(see Experimental Section for details). A
Poisson distribution was fitted to the number of fluorescence positive
(i.e., propagon containing) droplets for each dilution factor at the
assay end point with the best fits yielding an average number of 2.1·1011 propagons per μL (accurate to within a factor of 1.1, n = 2) in the standard fibril sample (Figure 3c and Experimental Section). Moreover, under these conditions, we obtained a very low average
false positive rate of only ∼0.4% spontaneously aggregating
reactions in a total of about 700 droplets of the unseeded control
(Figure S2). Because of the high level
of conformity of the data to the Poisson distribution model, we conclude
that the assay is capable of amplifying single propagons in picoliter
droplets and allows the precise quantification of absolute numbers
of propagons at low femtomolar concentrations.

quantification. (a) Representative fluorescence

droplets as a function of the logarithm of the dilution factor. Every
data point represents the mean ± SD from two independent experiments
of d-AQuA. A Poisson distribution (gray line) was fitted to the data
to quantify the number of propagons in the standard fibril sample.

Validation of the Number
of Propagons by AFM
To monitor
the number of propagons determined by d-AQuA with an alternative method,
we used AFM to estimate the dimensions and the physical number of
fibrillar aggregates present in the standard fibril sample (Figure 4a). The average contour length of the fibrils was (50 ±
35) nm (Figure 4b)
and the height was (5.3 ± 1.7) nm (Figure 4c). We used these dimensions and mass conservation
to calculate the physical number of fibrils per unit volume of the
standard fibril sample (see Experimental Section for details). The calculations yielded an average number of 1.1·1012 μL–1 fibrils. This number is closely
similar (less than an order of magnitude, i.e. within a factor of
∼5) to the number of propagons determined by d-AQuA (2.1·1011 propagons μL–1). A possible explanation
for the small difference between these numbers might be that not all
fibrillar aggregates detected by AFM also act as active propagons
in d-AQuA. We therefore conclude that the active propagons detected
by d-AQuA are essentially identical to a fraction of morphologically
defined fibrillar aggregates.

insulin fibrils. (b) Histogram of the fibril contour length distribution

distribution of the preformed insulin fibrils. A Gaussian distribution
(solid line) was fitted to the data to obtain the means ± SD
of the contour lengths and the fibril heights.

Comparison to a Digital Amyloid Amplification Assay in a Microplate
Microplate-based amyloid amplification assays in 96-well plate
formats with an analogue read-out are the current standard assays
for detecting amyloid aggregates in biological samples.26,27,34 To enable a direct comparison
between the sensitivity of this method with d-AQuA, we developed an
amyloid amplification assay for insulin in a microplate with a digital
read-out (Figure 5). As the precision of digital read-outs
increases with the number of replicate reactions, we established the
assay in a 384-well format. We also adapted the experimental conditions
to account for the higher volumes and larger surface areas used in
the microplate assay. A range of experimental parameters including
substrate protein concentration, temperature, shaking cycles, pH-value,
buffer conditions, and additives were systematically screened and
optimized for best assay performance. Especially crucial was the addition
of d-mannitol, which has been reported to suppress spontaneous
nucleation of insulin by stabilization of the monomer, while enhancing
the growth rate of existing fibrils.44 HCOOH
at pH 3.0 was chosen as the solvent, because of its reported ability
to reduce spontaneous aggregation of monomeric insulin.45 Finally, we identified a concentration of 2
μM soluble substrate protein in 0.75 M D-mannitol, 1 M GdmCl,
10 μM ThT, HCOOH (pH 3.0) with cyclic agitation (1 min at 300
rpm, 2 min quiescent) at 30 °C as optimal assay conditions. These
conditions resulted in an efficient reduction of spontaneous aggregation
to a false positive rate of 1–2% in 384 replicas over the course
of the experiment (24 h; Figure S2), while
yielding highly reproducible aggregation kinetics of the propagon-catalyzed
reactions (Figure 5a).

positive/negative scoring of the signals. (c) Fraction of positive
wells as a function of the logarithm of the dilution factor. Data

For digital quantification of
the propagon number in our standard
fibril sample, we again performed serial 10-fold dilutions of the
standard fibril sample (104- to 1015-fold dilutions
in monomer equivalents) using 16 replicas per dilution. The aggregation
time course was monitored by real-time ThT fluorescence over 24 h
(Figure 5a). At low
dilutions (104- to 109-fold), we observed lag
times of approximately 8 h, which gradually increased with higher
dilutions of preformed fibrils. End-point fluorescence signals of
reactions with low dilution factors (≤109-fold)
of preformed fibrils were all positive, whereas at higher dilutions,
only fractions of the replicate reactions appeared positive (14, 6,
and 1 out of 16 replicas for 1010-, 1011- and
1012-fold dilutions, respectively). All reactions at dilution
factors ≥1013-fold, as well as the control (without
preformed fibrils) were scored negative (Figure 5b). The fraction of positive signals was
correlated to the dilution factors, and a Poisson distribution was
fitted to the data (Figure 5c and Experimental Section). The best
fit yielded an average number of 1.4·109 propagons
μL–1 (accurate to within a factor of 1.2, n = 3) in the standard fibril sample (Figure 5c and Figure S3). These data show that the microplate assay (1.4·109 propagons μL–1) is also capable of detecting
individual propagons, but when compared to d-AQuA (2.1·1011 propagons μL–1) 2 orders of magnitude
less propagons were detected.

The detection of a lower number
of active propagons in the microplate
assay might be attributed to a loss of fibrils to various solid surfaces
during the extensive pipetting steps or to their adherence to the
microplate surface. Alternatively, the absence of solid contact surfaces
in the microdroplets or the small droplet sizes, associated with higher
effective concentrations,1 might result
in a higher number of effective propagons. High losses of propagons,
however, might significantly impair the sensitivity and reproducibility
of the assay and thus lead to an inaccurate quantification of the
number of propagons. Compared to the microplate assay, d-AQuA also
exhibited a greatly reduced average false positive rate of unspecific
amplification reactions in the unseeded control (∼0.4% compared
to 1–2%) and decreased assay time (∼8 h compared to
24 h).

D-AQuA also offers several important advantages over
the most commonly
used amyloid amplification assays, PMCA24 and RT-QuIC.25,46 First, the ability of d-AQuA
to perform large numbers of replicate measurements (up to 1400 in
d-AQuA compared to typically 3 to 8 in PMCA24 and RT-QuIC25,34) yielded highly precise data
sets. D-AQuA therefore enabled the detection of single propagons at
the ultimate limit of detection and absolute propagon quantification,
whereas the concentration in PMCA and RT-QuIC, is typically quantified
either in gram or mol or given as amyloid seeding activity (SD50)
or in tissue dilutions24,25,46 and thus does not define the number of propagons. When compared
to PMCA,24 d-AQuA also provided a simpler
and faster read-out by using ThT fluorescence instead of detection
by immunoblotting. In experiments described in this study, d-AQuA
also showed a significantly decreased assay time (∼8 h compared
to typically 1–3 days in PMCA24,46 and RT-QuIC46), reduced labor-intensive and time-consuming
pipetting steps and associated errors. Moreover, the use of pL-droplets
instead of μL-volumes significantly reduced the consumption
of reagents and, in particular, of the analyte, which is crucial,
when precious clinical samples with a low concentration of propagons
need to be analyzed. Hence, d-AQuA offers a substantial improvement
over the microplate assays for determining exact numbers of propagons,
a result that is of major importance in the context of ultrasensitive
detection and precise quantification of the number of low-abundance
propagons in a given sample.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we present a proof-of-concept method, d-AQuA, for
using digital microfluidics in combination with amyloid amplification
assays. We used insulin as model system and showed that d-AQuA allowed
us to run simultaneously up to 1400 parallel amplification reactions
per fibril dilution in pL droplets for extremely accurate and precise
digital data analysis. Our results showed that d-AQuA enables the
measurement of the activity of single propagons and the digital quantification
of the absolute number of propagons present in a sample. D-AQuA thus
reached the ultimate sensitivity limit of detection with the capability
to detect a single propagon.

Compared to a complementary microplate
assay, which also reached
the ultimate level of sensitivity, d-AQuA was shown to be the more
rapid and precise method and to have a higher recovery rate of low-abundance
propagons. This opens up the possibility for multiple applications.
For example, d-AQuA provides the potential, by correlating its data
with mathematical models, to address specific scientific questions
for a more fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms of
amyloid formation. In addition, d-AQuA might be of practical use for
the detection of even the smallest traces of insulin aggregates that
cannot be detected with existing analytical methods in biopharmaceutical
preparations of insulin products used for therapy in diabetes patients47−49 and may lead to an immune response in patients after subcutaneous
injection.49 Our technology also holds
the potential to be used for rapid, ultrasensitive and highly parallel
preclinical and clinical diagnosis through the detection of early
pathological propagons in protein misfolding and aggregation (PMA)
diseases for personalized medicine. In particular, a small-volume,
single-use disposable chip with the ability to diagnose accurately
PMA diseases from body fluids holds great promise for novel automated
diagnostic approaches. Finally, the technological innovations of d-AQuA
are well suited to the establishment of powerful high-throughput screening
platforms for the identification of novel aggregation inhibitors,
both in the context of stabilizing reagents for biopharmaceutical
products or as drugs to cure PMA diseases. We therefore envisage that
d-AQuA has great potential for advancing biomedical research and sensitive
point-of-care diagnostics for PMA diseases.
