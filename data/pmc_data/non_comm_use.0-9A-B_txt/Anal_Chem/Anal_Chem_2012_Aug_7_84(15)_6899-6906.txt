Macroion mobility spectrometry was used to distinguish
between
a monoclonal antibody (clone M612165) that bound exclusively to monomeric
prostate specific antigen and a different monoclonal antibody (clone
M612166) that bound exclusively to a dimeric form of the antigen that
only comprised 6.8% of the total protein. In the presence of excess
antigen, the mobility spectrum of M612165 was replaced by a composite
spectrum that represented a mixture of antibodies that included either
one or two equivalents of the protein antigen. In similar circumstances,
the mobility spectrum of M612166 was replaced by a composite spectrum
that represented a mixture of antibodies that included either two
or four equivalents of the protein antigen. When exposed to either
of the two antibodies, the mobility spectrum of the prostate specific
antigen showed a concomitant decrease in the monomeric antigen in
one case and in the dimeric antigen in the other case. While sensitive
kinetic exclusion assays demonstrated large differences in the antigen
binding behavior of the two antibodies, these functional studies alone
were insufficient to reveal the likely structural origins of the observed
differences. Macroion mobility measurements were shown to be a useful
and informative complement to functional studies in understanding
complex macromolecular interactions.

==== Body
The development of electrospray
ionization has led to powerful new tools for the study of proteins
and protein complexes. Electrospray ionization techniques are now
able to transfer macromolecules with masses over one million daltons
into the gas phase.1,2 Dilute solutions of proteins and
protein oligomers,3−8 nucleic acids,9 ribosomes,10 and small viruses4,11,12 can be dispersed into droplets of 100–200
nm in diameter. Desolvation of these droplets generates highly charged
particles that then pass through a neutralizing/charge reduction chamber13 where they are converted into neutral and singly
charged nanoparticles. The charged particles are then separated in
the gas phase according to their electrophoretic mobility and quantified
with a condensation particle counter. When the macromolecules are
prepared in a physiological buffer amenable to electrospray (i.e.,
dilute ammonium acetate), even noncovalent protein complexes can be
transferred intact to the gas phase.2,14 This technology,
variously referred to as electrospray ionization-ion mobility spectrometry
(ESI-IMS),1 nanoelectrospray gas-phase
electrophoretic mobility molecular analysis (nES-GEMMA or GEMMA),4 electrospray-differential mobility analysis (ES-DMA),
or macroion mobility spectrometry (macroIMS),15 was once available primarily to mass spectrometrists. However, complete
instrument packages for macroIMS are available commercially and the
technique is now accessible to any scientist with an interest in protein–protein
interactions.

Our laboratories are focused on antibody-ligand
interactions, and
heretofore we have used the macroIMS technology primarily for quality
control of our antibody preparations. MacroIMS has proven to be a
simple and convenient method for analyzing the degree of proteolysis
of our antibody preparations and for determining if antibody aggregation
has occurred after storage. Monoclonal antibodies are the fastest
growing sector in the pharmaceutics market today16,17 and their aggregation can have unpredictable consequences, including
the triggering of a severe or even life-threatening immune response
in patients.18,19 Bacher et al.12 were the first to utilize macroIMS to study IgG aggregation
and were able to resolve monomer, dimer, and trimers of bovine IgG.
When compared with size-exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation,
and dynamic light scattering, macroIMS demonstrated superior resolving
power in separating small percentages of dimers, trimers, and tetramers
from main monomeric IgG peaks.20 Further,
macroIMS does not expose proteins to large solid–liquid interfaces,
thereby avoiding the underestimation of aggregate levels as compared
with size-exclusion chromatography.20

In this study, we report the use of macroIMS to demonstrate that
prostate specific antigen (PSA) can also exist as a dimer. The macroIMS
technique was used to study the interaction of PSA and its dimer with
two monoclonal antibodies that bind to PSA. The combination of macroIMS
and kinetic exclusion analysis21 revealed
a heretofore unrecognized specificity of one of these monoclonal antibodies,
that it bound preferentially to a PSA dimer. Analysis of binding data
based on this newly characterized binding specificity helped resolve
anomalous kinetic binding parameters reported previously for one of
these antibodies.22

Experimental Section
Materials
Free prostate specific antigen that was purified
from human seminal fluid and two purified mouse monoclonal antibodies
directed against human PSA (clones M612165 and M612166) were purchased
from Fitzgerald Industries, International (Concord, MA). Covalent
conjugates of Cy5 and affinity-purified goat antimouse (Fab)2-specific antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories,
Inc. (West Grove, PA). UltraLink Biosupport, an azlactone-activated
beaded polyacrylamide resin (50–80 μM diameter), was
purchased from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL). All other chemicals
were reagent grade.

Kinetic Exclusion Assays
Kinetic exclusion assays were
conducted using a KinExA 3000 flow fluorimeter purchased from Sapidyne
Instruments, Inc. (Boise, ID). The general KinExA assay procedures
are described in detail elsewhere.21,23,24 All of the functional binding assays were conducted
at 25 °C in Hepes-buffered saline (HBS), comprised of 137 mM
NaCl, 3.0 mM KCl, and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4. The KinExA 3000 device
is an immunoassay instrument that exploits an immobilized form of
the antigen to separate and quantify the fraction of unoccupied binding
sites that remain in reaction mixtures of antibody and antigen. The
immobilized capture reagent for these studies consisted of PSA covalently
coupled via its available lysine residues to azlactone-activated polyacrylamide
beads. Dry amine-reactive beads (50 mg) were incubated with 1.0 mL
of 100 μg/mL PSA in 0.085 M sodium carbonate, pH 9.5, for one
hour at 25 °C. The beads were then washed three times with 1.0
mL of distilled water, and any remaining amine-reactive sites on the
beads were blocked by incubation for two hours at 25 °C with
10 mg/mL bovine serum albumin in HBS amended with 0.03% (w/v) NaN3. Beads could be stored in this blocking solution for up to
two months at 4 °C. Immediately before use, the beads were diluted
into 30 mL of HBS. The excess unreacted bovine serum albumin was washed
away when individual aliquots of the PSA-coated beads were packed
into the capillary observation cell of the KinExA 3000.

Reaction
mixtures of antibody and antigen were incubated for at least one hour
to achieve binding equilibrium before analysis. The fraction of occupied
binding sites on the soluble anti-PSA was taken as  where ΔF is the observed
difference in fluorescence readings at the beginning and the end of
each experimental time course, and the subscripts 0, exp, and sat
refer to instrumental time courses that correspond to a soluble PSA
concentration of zero, an intermediate PSA concentration, and a saturating
concentration of PSA, respectively. The value of the equilibrium dissociation
constant, Kd, was obtained from a nonlinear
regression fit of the following rectangular hyperbola to the data  For kinetic studies, the fraction of unoccupied
binding sites that remained after seven seconds of reaction was taken
as  The value of the second order rate constant, kon, for the bimolecular association between
the soluble PSA and the antibody was obtained from a nonlinear regression
fit of the following exponential function of the PSA concentration
to the data21  The value of the corresponding unimolecular
dissociation rate constant, koff, for
the antibody–antigen complex was obtained from the identity
that Kd = koff/kon.

Macroion Mobility Measurements
Macroion mobility spectra
of individual proteins and protein–protein complexes were obtained
on a model 3980C macroIMS macroion mobility spectrometer from TSI,
Inc. (Shoreview, MN). The instrument consisted of a model 3480 electrospray
aerosol generator, a model 3080C electrostatic classifier, and a model
3776 macroion/nanoparticle detector. Protein samples from eight to
200 nM were prepared by diluting stock solutions that contained greater
than 1.0 mg/mL protein into 20 mM ammonium acetate. Any nonvolatile
salts that were present in the stock protein preparations were sufficiently
diluted in the samples such that any spurious nonprotein peaks that
were observed at low molecular masses did not interfere with the interpretation
of the protein spectra. Control analyses using proteins that had been
extensively dialyzed against 20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7.4, demonstrated
that neither the apparent masses nor the shapes of the resulting protein
peaks in the macroIMS were changed by the desalting procedure. An
example of such a comparison is shown in Figure S-1 in the Supporting Information. The ammonium acetate
was prepared fresh weekly and passed through a 0.2 μm filter
to remove any traces of particulate matter. If necessary, the pH of
the solution was adjusted to 7.4 using either ammonium hydroxide or
acetic acid.

Protein solutions for analysis were introduced
as electrospray droplets by forcing the analyte through a fused silica
capillary tube that terminated in a tip that was ground into a conical
shape (available from TSI). The shape of the resulting source of emerging
droplets was observed visually under magnification and controlled
by adjusting the electrospray voltage and air pressure. The typical
electrospray voltages ranged from 2.0 to 2.5 kV with currents ranging
from 200 to 300 nA. The air around the spray tip entered the electrospray
chamber at a rate of 1.5 L per minute; the capillary pressure differential
was typically 3.5 to 4.0 PSID. The sheath flow rate was 20 L per minute;
the flow rate into the condensation particle counter was 1.5 L per
minute. Electrospray voltage and air pressure were adjusted until
both the visible cone and the current were stable.

Multiply
charged macroions that were included in the electrospray
droplets then passed through a neutralizing/charge reduction chamber
where they reacted with bipolar air molecules generated from a 210Po alpha emitting source. Charge reduction changed the macroions
into primarily neutral and singly charged macromolecules. Proteins
and protein complexes were subsequently separated according to their
mobilities in air and counted as a function of 128 discrete particle
diameters from 4.78 to 15.1 nm by sweeping the voltage on the detector
from 34 to 755 V. A protein particle density of 0.575/cm3 was used to convert the particle diameters into the corresponding
mass range of 2.5 to 600 kDas.8 Each spectrum
consisted of the accumulated counts of 10 repeat scans of 300 s each.
The Sovitzky-Golay smoothing filter,25 available
in the MacroIMS operating software, was applied to the final spectrum
using a sixth-order polynomial with three points on each side of the
data point.

Spectra that represented mixtures of proteins or
protein complexes
were deconvoluted into sums of individual curves by iterative nonlinear
regression analyses. Each suspected protein peak was modeled according
to the distribution function  where X represents the molecular
mass, A1 is the average number of background
counts, A2 is the maximum number of counts
at the highest point on that peak, A3 is
the molecular mass of that particular protein species, and A4 represents the width of the peak at half-height.
The overall mobility spectrum was then modeled as the sum of the individual
distribution functions that represented each protein peak. Calculation
of the parameter values (A1 through An) that minimized the sum of
the squares of the residual values between the observed and calculated
values was accomplished using SlideWrite Plus for Windows (Advanced
Graphic Software, Inc., Encinitas, CA).

Results and Discussion
Antibody M612166 Bound Poorly to Immobilized Prostate Specific
Antigen
The binding of PSA to an immobilized anti-PSA monoclonal
antibody derived from clone M612166 was previously studied by 22 participants
representing 13 institutions/companies.22 Kinetic and equilibrium data were obtained using three different
surface plasmon resonance platforms. The contents of the resulting
22 separate data sets were in remarkable agreement, indicating that
the values of the second order rate constants for the bimolecular
association of soluble PSA with the immobilized antibody were within
15% of 4.1 × 104 M–1 s–1. However, this value was extremely low for an antibody–antigen
binding interaction that would typically have a low energy of activation.
For this reason, we wanted to reexamine this particular antibody–antigen
binding reaction.

Initial kinetic exclusion assays conducted
on the interaction of M612166 with PSA yielded observations that seemed
to be consistent with the surface plasmon resonance data. Figure 1 shows examples of two different primary antibodies
binding to immobilized PSA in a KinExA 3000 flow fluorimeter: curve
a, 1.0 nM antibody M612166, and curve b, 0.5 nM antibody M612165,
representing another anti-PSA monoclonal antibody that served as a
comparative control for these experiments. Curve c in Figure 1 shows the instrumental response when no primary
antibody was present in the analyte solution. The instrument response
from 210 to 330 s represented the amount of primary antibody that
was captured and retained on the immobilized PSA and was directly
proportional to the concentration of free antibody in solution (inset,
Figure 1). The magnitudes of the instrumental
responses obtained with antibody M612165 were typical of those that
our laboratories have observed with other antibodies and immobilized
antigens.26−30 The magnitudes of the instrument responses obtained with antibody
M612166 were much less than those obtained with other antibody–antigen
pairs. There could be a number of explanations for the apparent poor
binding of antibody M612166 to immobilized PSA, including, but not
limited to, the following: the bimolecular association rate constant
for the binding of the antibody to immobilized PSA is inherently low,
as had been reported previously;22 the
antibody has a very poor affinity for the antigen; or the immobilized
antigen is in the wrong conformation to promote rapid or high-affinity
binding of the soluble antibody.

a KinExA 3000 flow fluorimeter

Selected time courses of individual fluorescence responses when beads
bearing immobilized PSA were exposed in turn to mixtures of a primary
mouse monoclonal antibody (0 to 90 s), fluorescently labeled goat
antimouse antibodies (90 to 210 s), and a final buffer wash (210 to
330 s). Antibodies: a, 1.0 nM antibody M612166; b, 0.5 nM antibody M612165; and c, no primary
antibody. Inset, secondary plot of the differences in the final fluorescence
observed in the presence and absence of different concentrations of
primary antibodies M612166 (a) or M612165 (b), respectively.

PSA Preparations Contained a Dimeric Contaminant
As
part of an effort to understand why the binding of antibody M612166
to PSA appeared to be so poor, we subjected the highly purified protein
reagents used in this study to macroion mobility spectrometry to independently
assess their purity. The resulting spectrum for purified PSA is shown
in Figure 2. The principal peak, centered at
approximately 28 600 Da, clearly represented the purified free
PSA. However, a minor contaminant with a higher molecular mass was
always present in the same relative proportion in all spectra, regardless
of the concentration of the total PSA preparation in the analyte solution.
A clue as to the identity of this contaminant came from the analysis
of the spectrum by nonlinear regression calculations. The observed
spectrum was ably represented by the weighted sum of the contributions
from two proteins, the major peak (93.2%) centered at 28 600
Da and a minor peak (6.8%) centered at 54 600 Da. Either this
minor peak represented a structurally unrelated contaminant that was
present in this highly purified PSA preparation, or the minor peak
represented a stable dimeric form of the PSA. Although no evidence
for the dimerization of PSA can be found in the literature, the 5
to 6% uncertainty in the absolute accuracy of macromolecular masses
as determined by macroion mobility measurements12 suggested that the minor peak could very well be an unexpected
dimer of PSA. The possibility that the minor peak with the higher
apparent mass simply represented the contents of droplets that coincidentally
contained two unrelated monomers of PSA was discounted by two arguments.
First, the concentration of total PSA, 200 nM, and the approximate
volume of the individual droplets, 100 to 200 nL, dictated that these
electrospray measurements were in the “one analyte per one
droplet”31 operating regime. Second,
the relative proportion of the minor peak to the major peak did not
change when the concentration of total PSA in the analyte solution
was lowered as much as 10-fold below 200 nM. In addition, dilution
of the protein samples did not cause the peaks to either shift to
lower masses or change shape. Examples of macroIMS spectra obtained
with different concentrations of PSA are shown in Figure S-2 in the Supporting Information.

that the highly purified protein contained a dimeric contaminant.
The parameters for the solid curve drawn through
the data points were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using
the sums of the calculated mobility spectra for two protein species
with molecular masses of 54.6 and 28.6 kDa, representing dashed
curves a and b, respectively. The area under curve a represents 6.8% of the total area under the solid curve. Inset, a residual plot of the differences between
the observed and the calculated counts as a function of the molecular
mass.

Antibody M612165 Bound Exclusively to Monomeric PSA
The capacity for macroion mobility measurements to complement and
extend the results of functional binding studies is illustrated in
Figure 3. The binding of M612165 to PSA was
determined by kinetic exclusion assays using equilibrium reaction
mixtures comprised of a constant, limiting concentration of antibody
M612165 and different concentrations of excess total PSA. The immobilized
PSA in these assays was exploited to separate and quantify the fraction
of soluble antibody binding sites that remained unoccupied in the
equilibrium reaction mixtures of soluble antibody, antigen, and antibody–antigen
complexes. Unlike surface plasmon resonance and other automated instrumentation
devoted to the study of protein binding interactions in which the
interaction to be quantified is that between a soluble and an immobilized
binding partner,32−34 the equilibrium binding data determined by kinetic
exclusion assays are those obtained for the binding reaction in homogeneous
solution. The equilibrium binding of total PSA to a limiting concentration
of antibody M612165 is shown in Figure 3A.
The rectangular hyperbola drawn through the data points in Figure 3A describes a one-site homogeneous binding reaction
with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 5.6 × 10–8 M.

Figure 3 Monoclonal antibody M612165 bound monomeric prostate specific antigen.
A, equilibrium data for the binding of PSA to the antibody. The parameters
for the curve drawn through the data points were determined by nonlinear
regression analysis using a one-site homogeneous binding model and
a dissociation constant of 5.6 × 10–8 M. B,
kinetic data for the binding of PSA to the antibody. Antibody (1.0
nM in binding sites) and PSA were incubated for 7 s before separation
of the antibodies into bound and free fractions. The parameters for
the curve drawn through the data points were determined by nonlinear
regression analysis using a single exponential function of time and
total PSA concentration and a value for the bimolecular association
rate constant of 2.8 × 106 M–1s–1. C, macroion mobility spectra of antibody M612165
(20 nM in binding sites) in the absence (solid curve) and presence (solid curve with data points) of 200 nM total PSA. The parameters for the solid curve drawn through the data points were determined by
nonlinear regression analysis using the sum of the calculated mobility
spectra for three proteins: 0.67 nM unliganded antibody with a mass
of 150 kDas (not shown); 2.19 nM monoliganded antibody with a mass
of 176 kDas (dashed curve a); and 7.14 nM diliganded
antibody with a mass of 210 kDas (dashed curve b).
Inset, a residual plot of the differences between the observed and
the calculated counts as a function of the molecular mass. D, macroion
mobility spectra of 200 nM total PSA in the absence (a) and presence (b) of 10 nM antibody M612165. Inset,
difference spectrum representing the counts in curve a minus those in curve b. The peak of the difference
spectrum occurs at 28.5 kDas.

Kinetic data for the bimolecular association of
PSA with antibody
M612165 are shown in Figure 3B. In this case,
the reaction mixtures of limiting antibody and excess total PSA were
only seven seconds old and far from equilibrium when the antibody
molecules with unoccupied binding sites were separated from the reaction
mixture and quantified using the immobilized PSA. The fraction of
unoccupied binding sites was a single exponentially decreasing function
of the total PSA concentration from which a second order rate constant
of 2.8 × 106 M–1 s–1 was determined for the antibody–antigen binding reaction
in solution.

Since the antibody–PSA complex had demonstrably
greater
mass than either the free antibody or the PSA alone, macroion mobility
spectra were also conducted on antibody–antigen reaction mixtures
to verify the anticipated masses and stoichiometries of different
protein complexes that should be present. Figure 3C shows macroion mobility spectra for 10 nM antibody M612165
in the absence and presence of 200 nM total PSA. In the absence of
antigen (solid curve), the antibody appeared as a single symmetrical
peak (on the semilogarithmic plot) with no evidence for aggregated
species or proteolytic breakdown products. In the presence of excess
PSA (solid curve with data points), the resulting mobility spectrum
was fit with a curve that represented the weighted sum of the curves
of three proteinaceous species: 0.67 nM unliganded antibody at 150
kDas; 2.19 nM monoliganded antibody at 176 (150 + 26) kilodaltons
(dashed curve a); and 7.14 nM diliganded antibody
at 210 (150 + 60) kilodaltons (dashed curve b). These
were the approximate concentrations and molecular masses that one
would expect from a divalent antibody that independently bound two
monomeric PSA molecules with an equilibrium dissociation constant
of 5.6 × 10–8 M.

The data in Figure 3D show
the macroion mobility spectra in the molecular mass range from 10
to 100 kDas for 200 nM total PSA in the absence (curve a) and presence (curve b) of 10 nM antibody M612165.
The inset shows a difference spectrum of curve a minus curve b. The peak of the
difference spectrum is centered at 28,000 Da. It was evident that
the presence of antibody M612165 exclusively lowered the concentration
of soluble monomeric PSA. The signal intensities in curves
a and b were reliable quantitative measures
of the PSA concentration. Control measurements showed that the area
under each macroIMS spectrum was directly proportional to the PSA
concentration in the analyte. Figure S-3 in the Supporting Information shows a standard curve of the total
raw counts under each spectrum as a function of the concentration
of PSA. The addition of antibody M612165 had no discernible effect
on the concentration of the soluble higher mass contaminant in the
PSA preparation.

Antibody M612166 Bound Exclusively to Dimeric PSA
The
data in Figure 4 show the results of applying
the same two complementary experimental methods to the binding of
the same preparation of PSA to antibody M612166. The equilibrium binding
of total PSA to a limiting concentration of antibody M612166 is shown
in Figure 4A. The rectangular hyperbola (solid line) drawn through the data points in Figure 4A describes a one-site homogeneous
binding reaction with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 5.7
× 10–8 M. The actual data points exhibited
lower signal-to-noise characteristics than did the corresponding binding
data in Figure 3A, but that
is a likely consequence of the relatively poor capture of antibody
M612166 compared with that of antibody M612165 on the immobilized
PSA as discussed above for Figure 1. The dashed curve in Figure 4A represents a binding reaction with an equilibrium dissociation constant
of 1.1 × 10–9 M, the value for the binding
of PSA to antibody M612166 that was reported earlier using surface
plasmon resonance measurements.22 This
graph illustrates that, when using the total concentration of PSA
as the same basis for comparison, the values of the equilibrium dissociation
constants for the same binding reaction as determined by kinetic exclusion
assay and surface plasmon resonance differed by 5-fold.

bound dimeric prostate specific antigen.
A, equilibrium data for the binding of PSA to the antibody. The parameters
for the curve drawn through the data points were determined by nonlinear
regression analysis using a one-site homogeneous binding model and
dissociation constants for total and dimeric PSA of 5.7 × 10–8 and 3.9 × 10–10 M, respectively.
B, kinetic data for the binding of PSA to the antibody. Antibody (5.0
nM in binding sites) and PSA were incubated for 7 s before separation
of the antibodies into bound and free fractions. The parameters for
the curve drawn through the data points were determined by nonlinear
regression analysis using a single exponential function of time and
total or dimeric PSA concentrations and values for the bimolecular
association rate constants of 5.3 × 105 M–1s–1 or 7.8 × 106 M–1s–1, respectively. The values on the upper X-axes in A and B represent 6.8% of the values
on the corresponding lower X-axes. The dashed curves in A and B represent the corresponding
equilibrium and kinetic binding, respectively, of total PSA to antibody
M612166 as determined elsewhere by surface plasmon resonance measurements.
C, macroion mobility spectra of antibody M612166 (16 nM in binding
sites) in the absence (solid curve) and presence (solid curve with data points) of 200 nM total PSA. The parameters
for the solid curve drawn through the data
points were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using
the sum of the calculated mobility spectra for three proteins: 0.74
nM unliganded antibody with a mass of 150 kDas (not shown); 1.98 nM
monoliganded antibody with a mass of 205 kDas (dashed curve
a); and 5.28 nM diliganded antibody with a mass of 275 kDas
(dashed curve b). Inset, a residual
plot of the differences between the observed and the calculated counts
as a function of the molecular mass. D, macroion mobility spectra
of 200 nM total PSA in the absence (a) and presence
(b) of 8.0 nM antibody M612166. Inset, difference spectrum representing the counts in curve a minus those in curve b. The peak of the difference
spectrum occurs at 55.8 kDas.

Kinetic data for the bimolecular association of
PSA with antibody
M612166 are shown in Figure 4B. The fraction
of unoccupied binding sites was a single exponentially decreasing
function of the total PSA concentration from which a second order
rate constant of 5.3 × 105 M–1 s–1 was determined for the antibody–antigen binding
reaction in solution. The dashed curve in Figure 4B represents the equivalent progress of a binding
reaction characterized by a second order rate constant of 4.1 ×
104 M–1 s–1, the value
reported earlier for the binding of the same two reagents using surface
plasmon resonance measurements.22 Although
the rate of PSA binding to antibody M612166 as determined by kinetic
exclusion assay was an order of magnitude faster than that reported
by surface plasmon resonance measurements, the higher value was still
far slower than one might expect for a typical antibody–antigen
binding interaction that could approach a diffusion-controlled transport
limitation.

Figure 4C shows macroion
mobility spectra
in the molecular mass range from 100 to 500 kDas for 8.0 nM antibody
M612166 in the absence and presence of 200 nM total PSA. In the absence
of antigen (solid curve), antibody M612166 appeared as a single symmetrical
peak with no evidence for aggregated species or proteolytic breakdown
products. In the presence of excess protein antigen (solid curve with
data points), new protein peaks appeared with molecular masses higher
than those anticipated for an antibody that only bound one or two
equivalents of monomeric PSA. The observed mobility spectrum in the
presence of excess total PSA was fit with a curve that represented
the weighted sum of the curves of the following three proteinaceous
species: 0.74 nM unliganded antibody at 150 kDas; 1.98 nM antibody
with a total mass of 205 kDas (dashed curve a); and
5.28 nM antibody with a total mass of 275 kDas (dashed curve
b). The differences in mass between the unliganded antibody
M612166 and each of the two new protein peaks, 55 and 125 kDas, were
consistent with the hypothesis that antibody M612166 recognized and
bound exclusively to the dimeric form of PSA that was present in the
highly purified preparation. Thus the two new protein peaks with higher
masses represented monoliganded and diliganded antibody where the
ligand in question was dimeric PSA.

Further support for this
hypothesis came from the macroion mobility
spectra in the molecular mass range from 10 to 100 kDas for 200 nM
PSA in the absence (curve a) and presence (curve b) of 8 nM antibody M612166, as illustrated in Figure 4D. The inset shows
a difference spectrum of curve a minus curve
b. The peak of the difference spectrum is centered at 55 800
Da. It was evident that the presence of antibody M612166 exclusively
lowered the concentration of soluble dimeric PSA. The addition of
antibody M612166 had no detectable effect on the concentration of
the soluble monomeric PSA in the highly purified PSA preparation.
It should be noted that no evidence was obtained that suggested that
the monomeric PSA was in a facile or reversible equilibrium with the
dimeric form. Thus the soluble dimeric PSA that was removed by binding
to antibody M612166 was not rapidly replaced from the large pool of
monomeric PSA as one would anticipate from the principle of mass action.
Nor was the proportion of dimeric PSA dependent on the concentration
of monomeric PSA over a 10-fold range in total PSA concentrations.

The realization that antibody M612166 bound exclusively to dimeric
PSA prompted a reexamination of the equilibrium and kinetic data in
Figures 4A and B, respectively. The upper X-axes in Figures 3A and B represent the concentration of dimeric PSA within
the total PSA concentration represented on the corresponding lower X-axes. When analyzed on the basis
of the concentration of dimeric PSA, the apparent equilibrium dissociation
constant for the binding of dimeric PSA to antibody M612166 decreased
from 5.7 × 10–8 to 3.9 × 10–10 M, while the value of the apparent second order rate constant for
the bimolecular association of the two proteins increased from 5.3
× 105 M–1 s–1 to
a more respectable value of 7.8 × 106 M–1 s–1.

The combination of structural and functional
studies presented
herein provided for a much more insightful and powerful means of investigating
the binding reaction than could have been achieved using either method
alone. The published observation based on surface plasmon resonance
measurements that the bimolecular association rate constant for the
binding of antibody M612166 to PSA was only 4.1 × 104 M–1 s–1 should, perhaps, have
prompted a further investigation as to why that value was so low.
In the present study, the observations that (i) the capture and retention
of soluble antibody M612166 by immobilized PSA was relatively ineffective
and (ii) the value of the bimolecular second order rate constant for
the soluble binding reaction was still unexpectedly low (5.3 ×
105 M–1 s–1) both prompted
our further investigations into the possible structural origins of
the unexpected functional behavior of monoclonal antibody M612166.
It is evident that the macroion mobility studies complemented and
extended the interpretation of the functional binding studies. Similarly,
it is equally evident that the functional binding studies served to
complement and extend the interpretation of the structural studies.
Although we did not do so, it should be possible to obtain accurate
equilibrium dissociation constants if macroion mobility spectra, such
as those shown in Figures 3C and 4C were acquired at different concentrations of the excess
protein antigen. Given the currently available instrumentation, it
is not feasible to conduct kinetic binding studies using macroion
mobility measurements. However, this study, which combined binding
studies with measurements of the molecular masses of antibody–antigen
complexes, together comprised a whole that was greater than the sum
of its parts. Such an integrated approach may serve as a model for
many other studies of protein–ligand interactions.

If
one accepts the premise that antibody M612166 binds exclusively
to a dimeric form of PSA, then one cannot simply go back and reinterpret
the results of the prior surface plasmon resonance measurements22 until one knows the percentage or concentration
of the PSA dimer in the preparation used previously. The structural
data on soluble PSA presented herein is only applicable to the characteristics
of this one preparation. But the conclusion, that antibody M612166
binds exclusively to dimeric PSA, is presumably applicable to all
preparations of the antibody. It is evident that the dimeric PSA presents
a unique epitope that is not present or readily accessible in the
properly folded monomeric PSA. Further research in our laboratories
will examine the structural features of this dimeric PSA and how they
differ from the monomeric PSA.

Conclusions
These data illustrate the advantages of
incorporating both structural
and functional measurements when investigating even relatively simple
macromolecular binding interactions. Detailed functional studies,
whether they are kinetic exclusion assays, surface plasmon resonance
measurements, quartz crystal microbalance studies, isothermal titration
calorimetry, or some other analytical means, can accurately characterize
kinetic or equilibrium binding anomalies, but the same functional
studies cannot necessarily provide data to eliminate various hypotheses
to account for the source(s) of the apparent anomaly. In the present
case, the macroion mobility measurements on the reactants and products
of the binding reactions enabled us to propose simple, straightforward
hypotheses that adequately accounted for the functional differences
observed with the two different antibodies that bound the same protein
antigen preparation. Further, the macroIMS measurements were performed
relatively rapidly, and the resulting spectra were sensitive to small
differences in mass and easily interpreted. There is no guarantee
that we could have arrived at the same conclusions had we substituted
analytical ultracentrifugation, flow field flow fractionation, gel
filtration chromatography, or static/dynamic light scattering analyses
for macroIMS measurements. The advantages of including macroIMS measurements
in investigations of macromolecules and their interactions are evident.
