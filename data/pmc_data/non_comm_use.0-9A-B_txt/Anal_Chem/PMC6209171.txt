High-throughput mass
spectrometry (MS) glycomics is an emerging
field driven by technological advancements including sample preparation
and data processing. Previously, we reported an automated protocol
for the analysis of N-glycans released from plasma
proteins that included sialic acid derivatization with linkage-specificity,
namely, ethylation of α2,6-linked sialic acid residues and lactone
formation of α2,3-linked sialic acids. In the current study,
each step in this protocol was further optimized. Method improvements
included minimizing the extent of side-reaction during derivatization,
an adjusted glycan purification strategy and mass analysis of the
released N-glycans by ultrahigh resolution matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance
MS. The latter resolved peak overlap and simplified spectral alignment
due to high mass measurement precision. Moreover, this resulted in
more confident glycan assignments and improved signal-to-noise for
low-abundant species. The performance of the protocol renders high-throughput
applications feasible in the exciting field of clinical glycomics.

==== Body
Without compromising
the value
of genomic and transcriptomic analyses it is widely acknowledged that
the complexity of the human body largely arises from variations in
protein expression as well as modifications between cells, tissues
and body fluids. In this context, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics
has greatly contributed to an understanding of cellular functions
at a molecular level.1 Interestingly, in
MS-based biomarker discovery efforts protein glycosylation has often
not been taken into account, albeit that glycoproteins are key players
in biological processes, such as cell adhesion, endocytosis, receptor
activation, signal transduction, molecular trafficking, and clearance.2,3 Moreover, glycosylation has proven to be reflective of (and in some
cases causal to) disease etiology. Notable examples include tumor
growth and metastasis, various inflammatory conditions and autoimmune
diseases, and congenital disorders of glycosylation.4,5 This neglect of glycans, and proteoforms in general, can be rationalized
from data complexity and technical challenges.6−8 In MS-based
proteomics, database searches methyl-, phosphate-, and acetyl-groups
are accommodated by an exactly defined mass difference, whereas glycans
have different sizes (monomeric to oligomeric) that moreover can be
isobaric. With regard to technical considerations, the applied analytical
methods require high-throughput (HT) platforms to study the clinical
relevance of protein glycosylation in large-scale studies, as larger
sample sizes have a higher risk of errors and inconsistencies in sample
preparation, leading to poor repeatability.9

Multiple HT methods have been developed for proteomics10,11 and glycomics9,12,21,13−20 purposes. For released N-glycan analysis several
HT methods are available: capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced
fluorescence detection (CE-LIF),13,14 ultraperformance
liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (UPLC-FLD),15,17 and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry
(MALDI)-MS.12,22 Some of these methods include
LC runs, which show a relatively lower throughput compared to MALDI-MS
and multiplexed CE-LIF. In addition, fluorescence detection is often
used, which has limitations for highly complex samples due to potentially
overlapping signals. Here we present a high-performance mass spectrometric
glycomics assay which includes automated sample preparation and high
resolution mass spectrometry. This assay shows a range of advantages
as compared to other workflows and is based on our previous plasma
glycomics protocol that includes sialic acid derivatization with linkage-specificity
and a plate-based method for glycan purification. High throughput:
The assay can be run at high throughput allowing the measurement of
576 samples within 1 day, thereby making the analysis of large-scale
clinical cohorts possible. High coverage: 120 glycans were detected
from human plasma applying linkage-specific sialic acid derivatization,
90 glycans whereof were consistently quantified. High confidence identification:
artifacts and contaminants were minimized by optimizing the sample
preparation. Together with the high-resolution, high mass accuracy
and precision, this tackled issues regarding signal overlap and allowed
confident glycan identification. High performance relative quantification:
Due to the automated and optimized sample preparation including cotton
thread microsolid phase extraction tips, reproducible glycan profiles
were obtained. This novel high-performance workflow allows the robust
performance of large-scale clinical glycomics studies.

Experimental
Section
Samples
Plasma standard (Visucon-F frozen normal control
plasma, pooled from 20 human donors, citrated and buffered with 0.02
M HEPES) was purchased from Affinity Biologicals (Ancaster, ON, Canada)
and used for all experiments.

Chemicals, Reagents, and
Enzymes
Analytical grade ethanol,
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and potassium
hydroxide (KOH) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Disodium
hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Na2HPO4 ×
2H2O), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4), sodium chloride (NaCl), N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 85% phosphoric
acid (H3PO4), 50% sodium hydroxide (NaOH), nonidet
P-40 substitute (NP-40), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole 97% (HOBt) and super-DHB
(9:1 mixture of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic
acid, sDHB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany).
1-Ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide (EDC) hydrochloride
was obtained from Fluorochem (Hadfield, UK), whereas recombinant peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) was obtained from Roche Diagnostics
(Mannheim, Germany) and HPLC-grade acetonitrile (ACN) was purchased
from Biosolve (Valkenswaard, The Netherlands). Milli-Q water (MQ)
was generated from a Q-Gard 2 system (Millipore, Amsterdam, The Netherlands),
which was maintained at ≥18 MΩ.

Enzymatic N-Glycan Release
The enzymatic
release of N-glycans from plasma proteins was performed
as previously described, however using an acidified PBS buffer.12,23−25 Briefly, acidified PBS (pH 5.6) was prepared by adding
68 μL of 85% phosphoric acid to 9.93 mL of 5× PBS solution.
Then, 6 μL of plasma was added to 12 μL of 2% SDS and
incubated at 60 °C for 10 min. Next, 12.6 μL of freshly
prepared releasing mixture (6 μL of 4% NP-40, 6 μL of
acidified PBS, and 0.6 μL of PNGase F) was added, and the samples
were overnight incubated at 37 °C. Thus, prepared samples were
stored at −20 °C until further analysis and measurement.

Automated Sample Preparation
The derivatization, hydrophilic
interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) purification, and MALDI-target
plate spotting were performed using an automated liquid handling platform
as described in Bladergroen et al.12 This
platform allows for processing of 96 samples (i.e., one microtitration
plate (MTP)) in a simultaneous manner and can accommodate sequential
processing of six MTPs without interruption. The first plate requires
1.5 h for processing, whereas the following ones each add half an
hour to the total processing time due to efficient (overlapping) time
scheduling.12 The ethyl esterification
derivatization was performed by adding 2 μL of released glycan
sample to 40 μL of ethyl esterification reagent (0.25 M EDC
with 0.25 M HOBt in ethanol) and incubating the mixture for 1 h at
37 °C.24 Subsequently 40 μL
of acetonitrile was added and after 10 min the purification was started.
In-house assembled microtips used for cotton HILIC microtip purification
were prepared as follows: 3 mm cotton thread (approximately 180 μg,
Pipoos, Utrecht, Netherlands) was placed into a 50 μL tip (clear
CO-RE tip without filter, Hamilton, Switzerland) by using tweezers.
Then, a polypropylene porous frit (DPX Technologies, Columbia GA,
United States of America) was placed 18 mm above the tip opening in
order to prevent the cotton thread from floating through the microtips
during purification. The cotton HILIC tips were three times prewetted
with 40 μL of MQ water and then conditioned with three times
40 μL of 85% ACN. Subsequently the sample was loaded by pipetting
the ethyl-esterified sample 20 times up and down (40 μL per
time). The HILIC tips were washed three times with 40 μL of
85% ACN containing 1% TFA, and three times with 40 μL of 85%
ACN. The purified N-glycans were eluted in 20 μL
of MQ water by pipetting five times up and down (pipet set at 15 μL).
Next, 10 μL of purified sample was premixed with 5 μL
of sDHB matrix (5 mg/mL in 99% ACN with 1 mM NaOH) and 3 μL
of the mixture was spotted onto a MALDI target plate (800/384 MTP
AnchorChip, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The spots were allowed
to dry in air, followed by MALDI-time-of-flight (TOF)-MS measurement
and subsequent MALDI-FTICR-MS measurement of the exact same spot.

Sample Workup for Studying Adduct Formation
The N-glycan release was performed three times in acidified
PBS (pH 5.6) and nine times in “regular” 5× PBS
(pH 7.3). Ethyl esterification was carried out according to the protocol
described above, however for the group of nine samples the reaction
was performed three times with three different activating agents:
0.25 M EDC, 0.25 M DCC, or 0.25 M DIC. The samples were subsequently
purified with the manual cotton HILIC solid phase extraction (SPE)
microtips as described previously,24,26 spotted onto
a MALDI target plate and allowed to dry in air.

MALDI-TOF-MS
MALDI-TOF-MS spectra were recorded in
reflectron positive mode on an UltrafleXtreme mass spectrometer (Bruker
Daltonics). The system was equipped with a Smartbeam-II laser and
operated by flexControl version 3.4 Build 135. Per sample 10 000
laser shots were collected at a laser frequency of 1000 Hz. The spot
was analyzed using a random walking pattern of 200 shots per raster
spot. Spectra were recorded with an m/z-range of 1000–5000.

MALDI-FTICR-MS and MS/MS
MALDI-FTICR-MS
measurements
were performed on a Bruker 15T solariX XR FTICR mass spectrometer
equipped with a CombiSource and a ParaCell (Bruker Daltonics). The
system was controlled by ftmsControl version 2.1.0 and spectra were
recorded with 1 M data points (i.e., transient length of 2.307 s).
A Bruker Smartbeam-II Laser System was used for irradiation at a frequency
of 500 Hz using the “medium” predefined shot pattern.
Each MALDI-FTICR spectrum was generated in the m/z-range from 1011.86 to 5000.00. At each raster 200 laser
shots were collected and each spectrum consisted of ten acquired scans.
The ParaCell parameters were as follows: the DC bias RX0, TX180, RX180,
and TX0 were 9.13, 9.20, 9.27, 9.20 V, respectively; the trapping
potentials were set at 9.50 and 9.45 V and the excitation power and
sweep step time at 55% and 15 μs. The transfer time of the ICR
cell was 1.0 ms, and the quadrupole mass filter was set at m/z 850. Collision-induced dissociation
(CID) experiments were performed in the m/z-range 153.34–5000 with 512 k data points. The quadrupole
(Q1) was used from precursor ion selection with an isolation window
of 12 mass units. Fragments were generated using a collision energy
of 75 V. DataAnalysis Software 4.2 (Bruker Daltonics) was used for
the visualization and data analysis of MALDI-(CID)-FTICR spectra.

Method Repeatability
The repeatability of the method
was evaluated by performing the sample preparation and measurements
multiple times on three different days. On day 1 the process described
in the section “automated sample preparation” was repeated
three times with 96 samples each time and on day 2 and 3 the process
was repeated once with 96 samples per day. From this data the intraplate,
intraday, and interday variation can be determined. The intraplate
variation was calculated over the total amount of spectra per plate.
The intraday variation was calculated over the total amount of spectra
from day 1 (plates 1–3) and the interday variation was calculated
over the total amount of spectra from all days (plates 1–5).

Preprocessing of Mass Spectral Data
The MALDI-TOF-MS
spectra were transformed in text format (x,y) using flexAnalysis 3.4 (Bruker Daltonics). The data transformation
to text format of the MALDI-FTICR-MS spectra was performed with DataAnalysis
3.1 (Bruker Daltonics). With MassyTools 0.1.8.1, the text files were
calibrated if at least five calibrants showed a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 9 or higher, which was the
case in all 480 MALDI-TOF-MS spectra and 479 out of 480 MALDI-FTICR-MS
spectra. The list of calibration masses is shown in the Supporting
Information Table S-1. In addition, the
spectra showing less than (average of all spectra) minus 3 ×
(standard deviation) of the analyte area above S/N 9 were excluded in the analysis (13 MALDI-TOF-MS spectra
and 6 MALDI-FTICR-MS spectra).

In the obtained spectra, the m/z values corresponding to 163 glycan
compositions including 19 “dummy signals” (as defined
in Table S-2) were integrated with a coverage
of 95% of the theoretical isotopic envelope per analyte. For the MALDI-TOF-MS
data an extraction window of 0.49 m/z-units was applied, while for the MALDI-FTICR-MS spectra an increasing
mass window was used for increasing m/z values (see Table S-3). Analyte curation
was performed with multiple quality criteria: the S/N of the analyte for the median of all spectra
had to be at least 6, the quality score for the comparison of the
theoretical and observed isotopic envelope of the analyte had to be
lower than 0.5 for the median of all spectra and the PPM-error of
the analyte had to be lower than 10 for the first quartile of all
spectra. All dummy analytes were excluded by these criteria. In addition,
64 signals were excluded for further analysis in the MALDI-TOF-MS
spectra and 53 in the MALDI-FTICR-MS spectra. The complete list of N-glycans included in the extraction is shown in Table S-4. In this list also the observed glycan
analytes that could not be extracted because of lacking intensity
or overlap with other signals are displayed. For MALDI-TOF-MS and
MALDI-FTICR-MS, spectra these were 5 and 19 analytes, respectively.
Additionally, for 10 analytes only the first isotopic peak could be
used for analysis, due to overlap of the other isotopic peaks with
other signals.

The extracted area values for the selected glycans
were normalized
to the sum of all areas for each spectrum separately. In addition
derived traits were calculated from single glycans using R-Studio
software with an in-house written script. The exact calculations for
these derived traits, including the information on which glycans are
involved in a certain trait, are shown in Table S-5.

Per analyte and trait the average area, standard
deviation (SD)
and relative standard deviation (RSD) were calculated. In addition,
the average RSD of the 25 most abundant glycans was determined. These
calculations were done for the intraplate, intraday, and interday
variation.

Results and Discussion
Protocol Development
The initial plasma glycomics protocol
that includes a sialic acid derivatization method with linkage-specificity
was used as a starting point for the development and optimization
of a high performance assay.12 Method improvements
included minimizing the extent of side-reaction during derivatization,
an adjusted glycan purification strategy and mass analysis of the
released N-glycans by MALDI-FTICR. The benefits of
MALDI-FTICR mass analysis of the plasma glycome will be presented
and compared to MALDI-TOF readout. With these improvements the assay
is now suitable for HT studies with predefined quality metrics.27,28 A resulting ultrahigh resolution glycan profile of the improved
and optimized protocol is exemplified in Figure 1. Here, released N-glycans
were accurately identified up to m/z-values higher than 4000. Moreover,
high precision measurement of mass differences allowed identification
of a byproduct as follows.

Figure 1 Annotated MALDI-FTICR-MS spectrum of released
total plasma N-glycome, with the signals assigned
as [M + Na]+ compositions. The glycans were enzymatically
released and subsequently
ethyl esterified, cotton HILIC purified and spotted on a MALDI-target
by the automated pipetting platform. The linkages and positions of
the monosaccharides are based on literature as linkage specific information
cannot be extracted from the MS-data, except for the N-acetylneuraminic acid monosaccharides of which the linkage is determined
by the ethyl esterification derivatization method.

Identification of a Byproduct from Derivatization
Upon
careful inspection of the MALDI-based glycan profiles (such as depicted
in Figure 1), it was
observed that satellites of annotated glycans appeared with mass increases
of +132.174 ± 0.002 and 357.205 ± 0.029 Da, respectively
(averaged over 114 profiles for three different analytes). Previously,
these were explained as unidentified reducing end modifications or
ionization variants, namely at +132.19 and +357.18 Da of each glycan
signal.29 These signals only appear when
the ethyl esterification method is used, so it is likely that one
of the chemicals used in this reaction reacts with the glycan. In Figure 2A, the hypothesized
reaction of EDC and other carbodiimides with the reducing end of the
glycan is illustrated. For this reaction it is assumed that the hydrolysis
reaction of the glycosylamine after PNGase F release has not completed
before addition of the ethyl esterification reagent. The resulting
molecule matches the observed m/z-values when it is ionized as [M + H]+. To further confirm
this hypothesis, fragmentation of the +132.19-signal of H5N4E2 at m/z 2434.002 was performed and showed that
the additional mass was indeed located at the reducing end and ionized
as a proton adduct (Figure 2B and 2C).

Figure 2 (A) Reaction scheme of
the observed reaction of the reducing end
glycosylamine with a carbodiimide activating reagent. Chemical structures
and reactions were drawn in Marvin (Marvin 17.26.0, ChemAxon). (B
and C) MALDI-CID-FTICR-MS spectrum of EDC-linked H5N4E2 selected at m/z 2434.002. For more fragmentation spectra,
see Figure S-1. (D) MALDI-TOF-MS spectra
of derivatized H5N4E2. In panel D1–3 the observed m/z difference between the free reducing end glycan
(H5N4E2 at m/z 2301.84) and the
same glycan with the different carbodiimides attached to the reducing
end is shown. The difference in peak shift corresponds to the mass
difference of the R-groups of the different carbodiimides. For these
samples, the glycan release was performed at regular pH 7.3. In panel
D4 a spectrum is shown of a glycan release reaction performed with
acidified PBS including ethyl esterification activated by EDC. In
this spectrum, no signals corresponding to bound EDC are found.

The observed fragments (see also Figure S-1) match the structure as it was proposed
in Figure 2A. This
reaction results in a theoretical
mass shift of 132.1763 m/z-units,
which matches the observed mass shift. To proof that it is truly an
addition of the complete EDC molecule, the reaction was also performed
with two carbodiimides with different side groups. For these samples
the glycan release was performed at regular pH 7.3. The results of
these experiments are shown in Figure 2D panel 1–3. The shift of the extra peaks corresponds
exactly to the mass differences between the different carbodiimides.
To test whether the artifact is linked to the presence of glycosylamines,
we performed the glycan release at slightly acidic conditions, knowing
that glycosylamines are sensitive to acidic hydrolysis. The glycans
from the sample in Figure 2D, panel 4, were released with PNGase F in acidified PBS and
ethyl esterified with EDC as an activating reagent. In this spectrum
no signals corresponding to the byproduct were visible. This is explained
by the hydrolysis reaction that is favored at lower pH. This adjustment
of the pH of the glycan release reaction prevents the presence of
glycosylamines in the subsequent ethyl esterification reaction. In
addition, it is worth noting that the signals at +357.205 Da also
disappear from the spectra when the glycan release is performed at
lower pH. This indicated that these satellites may indeed be linked
to the presence of glycosylamines. Interestingly, these peaks do not
change when using different carbodiimides, implying that the additional
mass originates from another source. Clearly, the “removal”
of these satellites of annotated glycans by performing the release
in acidified PBS simplifies the MALDI-profiles. It is furthermore
stressed that the here applied FTICR-MS read-out facilitates the identification
of other, obviously unwanted, satellite or unexplained signals. For
example, in MALDI-based analysis of glycans the potential loss of
the reducing end GlcNAc (−221.0899 Da or in the case of a core
fucosylation −367.1478 Da) should be taken into account, as
well as signals resulting from a 0,2A cross-ring fragmentation29 or a 2,4A cross-ring fragmentation
of the reducing end GlcNAc.29

Automated Cotton
HILIC Purification
It was found that
our initial GHP plate-based HILIC-SPE method for glycan purification
(GHP plate, Pall AcroPrep Advance 96 Filter plate, Pall Corporation,
Ann Arbor, MI) suffered from batch-to-batch differences for released
glycans.12 Both the signal intensity in
the spectra and the number of glycans visible in the spectra were
decreasing over time. A clear explanation for this decrease could
not be traced and for that reason an alternative purification method
was added to the protocol. Here, automated HILIC purification was
performed with cotton thread as the stationary phase that previously
has been used in manual purification protocols.24 For the automated method a piece of cotton thread was put
into a pipet tip and was kept in place by capping it with a porous
frit. These newly and in-house prepared microtips enabled the application
of cotton HILIC tips in an automated pipetting platform.

Using
the automated cotton HILIC tips for purification instead of a GHP
filter plate the spectral quality increased with respect to the signal
intensity and glycan coverage. Moreover, using purification tips instead
of a filter plate implies that there is no need to have a vacuum manifold
or centrifuge (for elution) available on the pipetting platform. Furthermore,
the overall throughput of the protocol is increased.

Glycan Assignments
As the resolving power in MALDI-FTICR-MS
spectra is higher compared to MALDI-TOF (ranging from 20 000
to 10 000 in TOF versus 100 000 to 50 000 in
FTICR30), overlapping species in the glycan
profiles become visible (see top and middle panel of Figure 3). The narrow peaks result
in a higher peak capacity in the spectrum and moreover are measured
at higher precision compared to MALDI-TOF-MS data. With suitable calibration
of the MALDI-FTICR-MS spectra (<5 ppm errors for calibrants), the
accuracy of the measurement increases to a level where the measured m/z can give a strong indication of the
monosaccharide composition of the analyte. As a consequence, fewer
false assignments are made and annotations are of higher confidence.
In addition, the number of detected glycan signals is increased due
to the larger dynamic range of the MALDI-FTICR-MS: signals with intensities
near the limit of detection in MALDI-TOF-MS spectra could not be included
for analysis, but the corresponding glycan signals in MALDI-FTICR-MS
spectra showed higher intensity and S/N ratio, which made it possible to include these signals in the analysis.
More details on the observed and relatively quantified analytes in
MALDI-TOF-MS versus MALDI-FTICR-MS are found in Table S-4.

Figure 3 Resolving power of MALDI-FTICR-MS. In the top MALDI-TOF-MS
spectrum
a single isotopic pattern is visible, while in the middle MALDI-FTICR-MS
spectrum there are two isotopic patterns observed. In the lower MALDI-FTICR-MS
spectrum the glycan signal of H7N6E4 can be distinguished from an
overlapping signal, but could not be extracted for relative quantification.

In the MALDI-TOF-MS spectra 86
glycan signals were annotated of
which 80 could be extracted for relative quantification. For the MALDI-FTICR-MS
spectra these numbers were 112 and 91, respectively. From these quantifiable
glycans 76 were extracted from both MALDI-TOF-MS and MALDI-FTICR-MS
spectra, 15 glycan signals were exclusively extracted in MALDI-FTICR-MS
and 4 were exclusively extracted in MALDI-TOF-MS spectra. It should
be noted that of these four MALDI-TOF-MS glycan signals (see Table S-4) one (H7N6E4) was observed in MALDI-FTICR-MS
spectra, but due to overlap could not be quantified, see Figure 3. The three remaining
glycan signals did not have a corresponding signal in MALDI-FTICR-MS
spectra, in fact it was observed that the isotopic pattern of these
signals did not correspond to glycan identities.

As a result
of the higher resolving power of MALDI-FTICR-MS measurements
the glycan signals were annotated with higher confidence. For most
of the annotated glycans we published in previous studies the current
data corroborated with proposed compositions. However, we also found
a few interesting exceptions. In both MALDI-TOF-MS and MALDI-FTICR-MS,
a signal was observed around m/z-value 3132.14 (see Figure 3). In previous MALDI-TOF-MS studies this signal was often
annotated as H6N5F1E3, a triantennary glycan which matches all quality
criteria of the data preprocessing. However, in MALDI-FTICR-MS spectra
not one, but two partially overlapping signals are observed, as is
shown in Figure 3.
One of these signals indeed matches the mass of the triantennary glycan
composition stated above, but the other signal can very well be annotated
as a signal corresponding to the tetraantennary glycan H7N6F1L1E1.
In MALDI-TOF-MS, it seemed that the signal was coming from one analyte,
while the resolution of the MALDI-FTICR-MS spectra show that this
signal is actually made up from two different glycan species. Notably
there were also some cases in which the previous annotation was proven
wrong. For example, a species previously assigned as H4N6F1E1 (m/z-value 2372.87) on the basis of TOF
data12 is now considered to be a byproduct
or adduct from another glycan, because the signal highly decreases
when the glycan release is performed at lower pH. In addition, there
were some signals which in MALDI-TOF-MS were annotated with some compositions,
such as H4N7E1, that are questionable in a biosynthetic manner. Here
the high resolution in combination with a good calibration showed
that the ppm error for this composition and signal was much higher
than for the other signals.

Repeatability of Glycan Relative Quantifications
From
the obtained MALDI-TOF-MS, as well as MALDI-FTICR-MS spectra, the
variation of the sample preparation combined with the measurements
was calculated for both systems. The intraplate-, intraday-, and interday
variation was calculated for the glycan with the highest relative
area (H5N4E2) (see Table S-6) and averaged
for the ten glycans (specific compositions are shown in Table S-6) with the highest relative area, which
is shown in Figure 4. In this figure also the variation of the 25 glycans with the highest
relative area is shown. The variation of all glycans is shown in Figure S-2 and in addition the variation of the
calculated derived traits is shown in Figure S-3. From the information presented in Figure 4 and Table S-7 we can conclude that the variation of the MALDI-TOF-MS and MALDI-FTICR-MS
measurements is similar to those reported previously: the variation
of the most abundant signal is found to be around 5%.12 For the ten most abundant signals the average intraplate
variation is 14.9% for the MALDI-TOF-MS measurements, whereas for
the MALDI-FTICR-MS measurements this variation is only 9.0%. When
comparing the interday variation this slight difference is also visible
with 16.5% and 9.9% variation for the MALDI-TOF-MS and MALDI-FTICR-MS
measurements, respectively. This shows that the variation in the MALDI-FTICR-MS
measurements is slightly lower than in the MALDI-TOF-MS measurements.

the same sample plate was processed once (respectively resulting in
plate 4 and plate 5). Error bars show standard deviation. H = hexose,

Conclusion
The
aim of the present research was to further develop and improve
our previous plasma glycomics protocol, which includes linkage specific
sialic acid derivatization, HILIC purification, and MALDI measurement.
In this study, the occurrence of side-reactions during derivatization
was successfully prevented and a newly automated HILIC purification
method was included. Moreover, the measurements were performed on
a MALDI-FTICR-MS instrument, providing ultrahigh resolution spectra
with resulting higher dynamic range and precision, which were proven
to be beneficial for the correct annotation and relative quantification
of the observed signals. These changes were made without affecting
the repeatability of the protocol. Taken together, the improvements
in the methods provide a time-efficient and repeatable protocol with
higher confidence identifications for glycosylation analysis in clinical
applications.
