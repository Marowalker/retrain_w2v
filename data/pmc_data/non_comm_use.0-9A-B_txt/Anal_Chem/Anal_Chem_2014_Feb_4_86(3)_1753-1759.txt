We
have monitored the production of the negatively charged lipid,
1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidic acid
acid (POPA), in supported lipid bilayers via the enzymatic hydrolysis
of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(PC), a zwitterionic lipid. Experiments were performed with phospholipase
D (PLD) in a Ca2+ dependent fashion. The strategy for doing
this involved using membrane-bound streptavidin as a biomarker for
the charge on the membrane. The focusing position of streptavidin
in electrophoretic-electroosmotic focusing (EEF) experiments was monitored
via a fluorescent tag on this protein. The negative charge increased
during these experiments due to the formation of POPA lipids. This
caused the focusing position of streptavidin to migrate toward the
negatively charged electrode. With the use of a calibration curve,
the amount of POPA generated during this assay could be read out from
the intact membrane, an objective that has been otherwise difficult
to achieve because of the lack of unique chromophores on PA lipids.
On the basis of these results, other enzymatic reactions involving
the change in membrane charge could also be monitored in a similar
way. This would include phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, lipid
biosynthesis, and additional phospholipase reactions.

Phospholipids
play important
roles in numerous cell membrane activities, such as protein binding,
intracellular signaling, apoptosis, and the synthesis of biomolecules.1−5 Different phospholipids and fatty acids can be interconverted through
various enzymatic reactions on the surface of lipid membranes.5 This includes phosphatidic acid (PA), which typically
accounts for 1–4% of the total lipid content of eukaryotic
cells.6 PA is a central lipid in signaling
reactions and serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of many other
lipids.5,7−9 It is also involved in
regulating membrane curvature and the vesicle fusion process.1,9−12

Activated by Ca2+, phospholipase D (PLD) catalyzes
the
hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to phosphatidic acid (PA) (Figure 1A).13,14 Such enzymatic activity is closely
related to intracellular signal transduction, the presence of cancer
cells, and other PA-related processes.9 A “ping-pong-like” catalytic mechanism has been proposed
for PLD activity.15 Namely, PC binds covalently
with PLD to form a PA-PLD complex with the release of choline. The
P–O bond between PA and PLD is then cleaved by the nucleophilic
attack of water on the distal phosphate ester.15 Real-time atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements have
demonstrated that PLD is released from the lipid bilayer surface after
the reaction is completed.16

Typically,
phospholipase reactions on phospholipids are monitored
by measuring the concentration of the products which are evolved.
For example, PLD activity has been monitored by measuring the concentration
of free choline released from PC using a two-step chromogenic assay
or using isotopically labeled choline.13,17−20 In the chromogenic assay, the released choline is first transformed
into betaine and H2O2 by choline oxidase. With
4-aminoantipyrine and sodium 2-hydroxy-3,5-dichlorobenzenesulfonate,
H2O2 then produces quinone dye in the presence
of peroxidase. The concentration of the quinone dye can be determined
by measuring its absorbance around 500 nm.13,18,19 In this case, successive experiments can
result in compounded errors and makes the assay less accurate. Indeed,
the concentration of the biologically relevant product, PA, has been
particular difficult to measure, simply because PA is a component
of many other phospholipids and lacks unique absorption peaks that
can readily be differentiated from other lipids. As a consequence,
it has been difficult to directly monitor the PLD-catalyzed PC to
PA conversion directly within intact lipid membranes. As such, there
are current efforts directed toward developing new assays for the
formation of PA in PLD-catalyzed PC hydrolysis. This includes very
recent work exploiting the use of ion current passing through a nanopore
in a black lipid membrane to follow PA production.21,22

Herein, we report a simple and straightforward method that
can
directly determine the percentage of POPA in supported lipid bilayers
(SLBs) by monitoring the electrophoretic-electroosmotic focusing (EEF)
position of a fluorescently tagged streptavidin molecule that is bound
to the membrane via a biotinylated lipid.23 Negatively charged membrane-bound proteins like streptavidin can
be focused on SLBs containing negatively charged lipids by counteracting
electrophoretic and electroosmotic forces (Figure 1B).21 These forces exactly balance
each other at the focusing position. Moreover, the zeta potential
of a focused protein should be equal to the local surface zeta potential
at the focusing position, which is directly related to the local surface
charge density. As such, streptavidin or other membrane bound proteins
can be exploited as indicators of the local surface charge density.
When an external electric field is applied laterally across an SLB,
negatively charged lipids spontaneously build up a concentration gradient,
generating higher negative surface charge density near the positive
electrode.21,2425 The
concentration of negatively charged lipids in the membrane strongly
affects the focusing position of the protein because the shape and
magnitude of the gradient that can be formed are directly involved.23

This assay exploits the fact that POPC
is uncharged (zwitterionic),
while POPA is negatively charged at neutral pH (Figure 1A). Thus, the PLD enzymatic reaction can convert an initially
neutral bilayer into one that contains negatively charged lipids.
After the reaction is completed and the enzyme is washed away, the
concentration of the negatively charged components can be monitored
via an EFF assay, when streptavidin is subsequently attached to the
surface (Figure 2). Specifically, the focusing
position of the streptavidin marker will migrate ever closer to the
negative electrode as the concentration of POPA is increased (Figure 1B).

Figure 2 Schematic diagram of the experimental procedure
for an EFF assay.
In a first step, PLD is introduced above the POPC bilayer in the presence
of Ca2+. This converts neutral POPC lipids to POPA. After
the reaction, PLD and Ca2+ are removed from the SLB surface
by rinsing in buffers containing EDTA. Finally, streptavidin biomarkers
are introduced to the SLB and the EEF assay is performed.

Experimental Section
Materials
Fibrinogen
was purchased from Sigma (St.
Louis, MO), while phospholipase D was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences
(Farmingdale, NY). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(POPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(cap biotinyl) (biotin-cap-DOPE), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidic acid (POPA) were purchased from
Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 1,2-Dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-Texas Red (Texas
Red-DHPE) and streptavidin were purchased from Invitrogen (Grand Island,
NY). Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was obtained from Dow Corning (Sylgard,
silicone elastomer-184). The specific dye-labeled lipid and biotin-conjugated
lipid/streptavidin pair were chosen for these experiments, as they
represent standard lipid membrane chemistries that are readily compatible
with the PA sensing assay developed herein.

SLB Formation
SLBs were formed by the vesicle fusion
method on clean glass coverslips (Corning, NY, 22 × 22 mm, no.
2).26,27 The coverslips were cleaned in a boiling
1:4 solution of 7× detergent (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) and
purified water. Purified water came from an Ultrapure Water System
(Thermo Scientific Barnstead Nanopure Life Science, Marietta, OH).
The coverslips were rinsed with copious amounts of purified water,
dried with nitrogen gas, and annealed in a kiln at 500 °C for
5 h before use. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared by
vesicle extrusion. To do this, the lipids were mixed in chloroform.
The chloroform was subsequently evaporated under a stream of nitrogen
followed by vacuum desiccation for 4 h. Next, the lipids were rehydrated
in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution which consisted of 10
mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.2 mM sodium azide. The pH
of the PBS solution was tuned to 7.4 with a small amount of 1 M HCl.
The concentration of the lipids in solution was 1.0 mg/mL. After several
freeze–thaw cycles, the solutions were extruded through a polycarbonate
filter (Whatman) with 100 nm pores.

To form SLB patches, fibrinogen
monolayers were patterned on glass coverslips using a standard PDMS
stamping method in a first step.23 Next,
SLB patterns were formed by vesicle fusion onto the bare glass areas
on the patterned glass slide.21−23 Each SLB patch was about 2 mm
long and 400 μm wide.

Fluorescence Imaging and Flow Cell Operation
Epifluorescence
images were obtained through a 10× objective using a Nikon E800
fluorescence microscope with a Roper Scientific MicroMAX 1024B charge-coupled
device (CCD) camera (Princeton Instruments). A flow cell electrophoresis
device was used to hold the pH and ionic strength conditions constant.23,28 All experiments were performed with a 10 mM Tris buffer solution
at pH 7.5. The buffer was flowed through the channels at a rate of
25 mL/h per channel.

Results and Discussion
In a first
assay, SLBs were composed of 99.4% POPC, 0.5% biotin-cap-DOPE,
and 0.1% Texas Red-DHPE. The biotin-cap-DOPE provided binding sites
for streptavidin. Texas Red-DHPE was added to monitor the formation
of the SLB, and also could be used as a secondary biomarker for obtaining
information about the concentration gradient of POPA after performing
electrophoresis. The movement of Texas Red-DHPE and streptavidin within
the SLBs was investigated during electrophoresis without exposing
the bilayer to any PLD. To do this, 5 nM Alexa-488-labeled streptavidin
in 10 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.5 was introduced above the SLBs and incubated
for 30 min. The streptavidin should bind tightly to the biotin-cap-DOPE
lipids under these conditions.23,25,28 Next, unbound proteins were rinsed away using 10 mM Tris buffer.
A fluorescence image of this system was obtained (Figure 3A). As can be seen, both the streptavidin and Texas
Red-DHPE were uniformly distributed across the SLB. After the application
of a 50 V/cm electric field for 45 min (Figure 3B), Texas Red-DHPE accumulated on the side of the SLB closest to
the positive electrode, simply due to the electrophoretic force on
this negatively charged dye-labeled lipid. Streptavidin also formed
a narrow band very close to the positive electrode edge. The focusing
of streptavidin occurred because Texas Red-DHPE and biotin-cap-DOPE
were negatively charged and established a shallow surface charge gradient.23,24 The line of focus for streptavidin was not quite as close to the
positive electrode edge of the bilayer as the Texas Red-DHPE and biotin-cap-DOPE
gradient. Moreover, the system shown in Figure 3B was at a steady state and the continued application of the 50 V/cm
potential did not alter the profiles of either streptavidin or Texas
Red-DHPE.

0.1% Texas Red-DHPE (red), 0.5% biotin-cap-DOPE and 99.4% POPC (A)
before and (B) after commencing the EEF experiment in a 50 V/cm electric
field.

In a next set of experiments,
we examined the effect of PLD activity
on the same initial SLBs, as described in Figure 3. Because Ca2+ is a key activator of PLD,14,19 the PA conversion rates were measured at four different Ca2+ concentrations: 0, 2.5, 5.0, and 10 mM CaCl2 (Figure 4). To perform an experiment, 10 μL of a 4.6
nM PLD solution were incubated over the SLB for 10 min. This was done
in a 10 mM Tris buffer solution at pH 7.5 and 20 °C. Next, the
PLD solutions were rinsed away with Tris buffer that also included
30 mM EDTA to ensure removal of the Ca2+ and, hence, dissociation
of the protein molecules.16 After this,
5 nM Alexa-488-labeled streptavidin was incubated over the SLBs for
30 min and rinsed away with buffer. EEF experiments were done in buffer
with a 50 V/cm electric field. As can be seen in Figure 4A (no Ca2+), streptavidin was focused to the same
position as found in Figure 3B. Indeed, without
Ca2+, PLD should not have any significant catalytic activity.19 Therefore, no POPA was formed and the focusing
position of streptavidin was unchanged, as expected. By contrast,
the experiments with 2.5, 5, and 10 mM CaCl2 all led to
a change in the streptavidin focusing position. For example, with
2.5 mM Ca2+, the streptavidin band focused to a position
about 125 μm away from the positive electrode edge of the SLB
(Figure 4B). Fluorescent line profiles for
all four streptavidin bands are provided in Figure 5. It should be noted that the formation of POPA was independently
verified by performing matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
(MALDI) experiments, and the expected masses were found. These data
are provided in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information.

The zeta potential and structure of bilayer-bound streptavidin
molecules should be essentially the same under all our experimental
conditions. Moreover, the zeta potential of the SLB and the bound
streptavidin should be equal to each other at the focusing line of
the protein.23 Therefore, the various focusing
positions of the streptavidin bands in Figure 4 are indicative of differences in the negatively charged lipid gradients
that are formed upon application of the electric field under the different
experimental conditions. Specifically, as more negatively charged
PA lipids are produced, the magnitude of the zeta potential adjacent
to the positively charge electrode will be higher.23 The gradient will also significantly broaden as the PA
concentration increases. Thus, the focusing position of streptavidin
will move ever further from the positive electrode upon the increase
in PA concentration. Plots of the zeta potential as a function of
position across the bilayer after the application of a 50 V/cm field
with varying concentrations of negatively charged lipids are provided
in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information.

The amount of POPA formed under the conditions employed herein
should vary linearly with the concentration of Ca2+.19 It should be noted, however, that with 10 mM
Ca2+, the streptavidin band was pushed all the way to the
negative electrode edge of the SLB (Figure 4D), which set an upper limit to the amount of POPA that could be
monitored with the current bilayer patch geometry and electric field
conditions. The streptavidin focusing position, x, varied continuously as a function of POPA concentration up to this
concentration limit, according to the following equation (Figure 6A):23 1  where percentagePOPA is the mole
percentage POPA in the SLB, K is a constant related
to the experimental conditions, vd (0.08
μm/s) is the drift velocity of POPA in the electric field, D (3.5 μm2/s) is the diffusion constant
of POPA, and rf is a
constant with units of length and is related to the boundary conditions
of the bilayer. See the Supporting Information for more details on the derivation of this equation.

The validity
of this model was verified by running control experiments
with known amounts of PA in the membrane. As can be seen, the plot
of the expected focusing positions (Figure 6A) correspond very well with data points from 0 and 10 mol % POPA
(Figure 6B). It should be noted that controls
with higher PA concentrations are not provided, as vesicle fusion
under these conditions required substantially altered buffer conditions
which would ultimately effect subsequent electrophoresis experiments.
On the basis of this calibration curve, the concentrations of PA produced
with PLA under the various Ca2+ concentrations were estimated
from the locations of the streptavidin bands. Specifically, the concentrations
of POPA generated from the 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 mM Ca2+ experiments
should be to be 0%, 7%, 33%, and at least 61 mol %, respectively.
Plots with the zeta potential value as a function of position with
each of these POPA concentrations is provided in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information. It should be noted that
concentration values for POPA reported under each set of Ca2+ concentrations was corrected for the fact that the membranes also
contained 0.6 mol % of negatively charged biotin-cap-DOPE and Texas
Red-DHPE.

The ■ along the blue line in (A) represent the actual focusing
positions found from the corresponding maxima in fluorescent intensity
from the streptavidin in (B).

As can be seen from the data in Figures 4 and 6, the width of the Texas Red-DHPE
band
significantly broadened as the POPA concentration increased. Quantitative
fluorescence line scans for the Texas Red-DHPE data from Figure 4 are provided in Figure 7. As can be seen, the higher the Ca2+ concentration (i.e.,
POPA mol %), the broader the Texas-DHPE band became. In addition,
the position of this dye-labeled lipid band shifted away from the
positive electrode. A maximum intensity peak could be observed on
the negative electrode sides of these bands at the highest POPA concentrations.
The reason for this should have two underlying causes. First, Texas
Red-DHPE has a large headgroup, which is subject to moderate electroosmotic
forces.29 As such, this band will reach
steady state closer to the positively charged electrode compared to
POPA. Moreover, POPA’s smaller headgroup should allow it to
pack more readily on the side of the bilayer closest to the positive
electrode. Since both POPA and Texas Red-DHPE are negatively charged,
the high concentration of the former lipid should actually help exclude
the latter from the most negatively charged portions of the membrane
on the positive edge of the bilayer upon electrophoresis. These facts
account for the fluorescence profiles observed with 5 and 10 mM Ca2+ as the Texas Red-DHPE builds up on electrophoretic grounds
as close as it can to the region of highest POPA concentration from
which it is depleted.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a label-free
detection method
that can characterize enzymatic membrane reactions by monitoring the
focusing position in electrophoretic-electroosmotic focusing experiments.
With comparison to conventional methods, the extent of the lipid headgroup
hydrolysis reaction can be determined directly within the intact membrane
because of the negative charge on the product lipid. This PLD enzyme
reaction assay on SLBs requires far less materials than bulk assays.
After detection, the SLBs can be restored to a well-mixed state by
turning off the applied electric field.

In the future, other
enzymatic reactions that involve changing
the charges on lipids could be monitored in a similar fashion. There
are a large group of such reactions, including phosphorylation, dephosphorylation,
lipid biosynthesis, and related phospholipase reactions.3,5,7,8 As
such, information on reaction rates as a function of membrane structure,
cholesterol content, the presence of double bonds on the lipid tails,
metal ions in solution, or related variables could all be tested.
Because this assay is run in a supported lipid bilayer environment,
it should be completely compatible with simultaneously running many
experiments both as a function of solution conditions as well as by
tuning the chemical content of the bilayer. Such multiplexed assays
could be performed by employing the appropriate microfluidic setup.30−32 As such, this assay has excellent potential for high-throughput/low
sample volume analysis of enzymatic reactions on lipids.
