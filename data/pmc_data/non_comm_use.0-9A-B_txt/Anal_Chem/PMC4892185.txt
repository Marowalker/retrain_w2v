DNAzymes, an important type of metal
ion-dependent functional nucleic
acid, are widely applied in bioanalysis and biomedicine. However,
the use of DNAzymes in practical applications has been impeded by
the intrinsic drawbacks of natural nucleic acids, such as interferences
from nuclease digestion and protein binding, as well as undesired
intermolecular interactions with other nucleic acids. On the basis
of reciprocal chiral substrate specificity, the enantiomer of D-DNAzyme,
L-DNAzyme, could initiate catalytic cleavage activity with the same
achiral metal ion as a cofactor. Meanwhile, by using the advantage
of nonbiological L-DNAzyme, which is not subject to the interferences
of biological matrixes, as recognition units, a facile and stable
L-DNAzyme sensor was proposed for sensing metal ions in complex biological
samples and live cells.

==== Body
DNAzymes,
with special DNA molecular
structures and enzymatic activities, can specifically catalyze a diverse
range of reactions, including RNA/DNA cleavage, ligation, or phosphorylation.1−3 DNAzymes have wide applications in the fields of biotechnology and
biomedicine.4−7 In particular, metal ions are necessary cofactors enabling most
DNAzymes to accelerate or inhibit catalytic reactions. As a result,
DNAzyme-based systems are ideal choices for the development of metal
ion sensors.8,9 By adjusting an activated loop,
allosteric DNAzymes have also been designed to detect noncofactor
targets.10,11 Currently, DNAzymes have shown the ability
to recognize a broad range of targets, including metal ions, small
molecules, proteins, viruses, and even bacteria.12

However, the practical application of DNAzymes, especially
in biological
matrixes, has been impeded by their intrinsic drawbacks, including
nuclease degradation,13,14 protein binding,15 and off-target effects from partial complementarity of
the DNAzyme to other DNA/RNAs,16 leading
to a nonfunctional DNAzyme. Meanwhile, the challenge in developing
an interference-free DNAzyme in biological fluids has been partly
addressed. For example, Lu et al. reported the cellular uptake of
a nuclease-resistant gold nanoparticle/DNAzyme conjugate, thus enabling
the detection of endosomal uranyl.17 This
is an encouraging report that has inspired the subsequent imaging
of other cofactors by using different protective nanomaterials,18−20 albeit with complicated design and engineering procedures. Thus,
a facile and stable DNAzyme for sensing metal ions in biological samples
is highly desired.

The concept of enantiomer in chemistry involves
stereoisomers that
are mirror images of each other but not identical, which has been
hypothesized and verified since enantiomorphic crystals were first
described by Pasteur more than 150 years ago.21−23 On the basis
of this idea, Kent et al. synthesized the D and L forms of the enzyme
HIV-1 protease,24 which have the same molecular
weight and identical covalent structure but opposite optical activity.
The hexapeptide analogue of a GAG cleavage site was then used as a
substrate to test the reactivity of the enantiomers. The results demonstrated
that both enzymes were equally active yet exhibited reciprocal chiral
specificity in that the L-enzyme could cleave only an L-substrate,
whereas the corresponding D-enzyme could cleave only the D-substrate.
Following Kent’s report, this principle was used to design
mirror-image enantiomers of nucleic acids, such as spiegelmers that
bind and inhibit target molecules and spiegelzymes that are able to
recognize complementary enantiomeric substrates and hydrolyze, ligate,
or polymerize them, thus facilitating new findings and applications.25−38

This concept inspired us to design a novel L-DNAzyme to circumvent
the drawbacks of D-DNAzyme, as noted above. On the basis of reciprocal
chiral substrate specificity, as explained above, D-enzyme is able
to catalyze D-substrate in the presence of an achiral metal ion. Correspondingly,
the mirror-image enantiomer of D-DNAzyme, L-DNAzyme, can perform the
same function with the help of the same achiral metal ion cofactor.
Importantly, the nonbiological L-DNA (Figure S1) is sufficiently stable to resist nuclease digestion and nonspecific
binding to natural proteins, and it cannot hybridize with any D-nucleic
acids.16,39−42 Therefore, by taking Cu2+- and Pb2+-dependent DNAzymes as two examples, the reported
D-DNAzyme sequences were adopted to systematically synthesize and
investigate the corresponding L-DNAzymes. It was found that the L-DNAzyme
possessed catalytic activity similar to that of D-DNAzyme in the presence
of the same achiral metal ion cofactors but with the extra merit of
biostability in such biological matrixes (Figure 1). Therefore, the L-DNAzyme was proposed
for detection of metal ions, both in serum and living cells, without
interferences from biological matrixes.

enantiomers. D-DNAzyme can selectively catalyze
substrate cleavage in the presence of achiral metal ion cofactors.
L-DNAzyme, the mirror form of D-DNAzyme, can perform the same function
with the help of the same cofactor. It is well documented that DNAzymes
in biological matrixes are subject to nuclease degradation, protein
binding, and off-target effects from partial complementarity of the
DNAzyme to other DNA/RNAs. In contrast, nonbiological L-DNAzyme is
resistant to such interferences of biological matrixes.

Experimental Section
Materials and Reagents
Cu2+- and Pb2+-dependent DNAzyme sequences
are shown in Figures S2A and S5A, respectively.
Both D- and L-DNAzymes
were synthesized on a PolyGen 12-Column DNA synthesizer, and the synthesis
reagents were purchased from Chem Gene (Wilmington, MA). Lead(II)
acetate, copper(II) nitrate, and all other reagents were of analytical
reagent grade, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. and used
without further purification. All solutions were prepared in Milli-Q
water (resistance > 18 MΩ cm) from a Millipore system. DNase
I and single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) were purchased from
Takara Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (Dalian, China) and Promega (Madison,
WI), respectively.

DNA Synthesis
Both D- and L-DNAzyme
were synthesized
with the same procedure. The synthesis protocol was set up according
to the requirements specified by the reagents’ manufacturers.
For Cu2+-dependent L-DNAzyme, an additional Dabcyl CPG
was used to synthesize the L-enzyme. The complete DNA sequences were
then deprotected in 30% ammonium hydroxide/40% methylamine 1:1 (v/v)
for 30 min at 65 °C and purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography.
An Agilent 1100 HPLC with a C18 reversed-phase column (solvent A,
0.1 M TEAA; solvent B, 95% acetonitrile; increased solvent B from
4% to 60% in 35 min) was used for probe purification. The Pb2+-dependent substrate (both L- and D-form), which contains adenosine
triphosphate, was purified with the following changes. After purification,
the product was incubated with DMSO (100 μL) and triethylamine
trihydrofluoride (125 μL) for 3 h at 65 °C to remove the
2′-TOM group. Next, 3 M sodium acetate (25 μL) and N-butyl alcohol (1.5 mL) were added, and the product was
incubated at −20 °C for 0.5 h to precipitate DNA. The
DNA concentration was determined with a NanoDrop spectrometer (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA).

Fluorescence Measurement
Fluorescence
measurement was
carried out on a Fluoromax-2 (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison, NJ)
fluorometer (for Pb2+-dependent DNAzyme analysis) or RF-5301-PC
(Shimadzu, Japan) fluorescence spectrophotometer (for Cu2+-dependent DNAzyme analysis). On the basis of the fluorescent properties
of FAM, the excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 490 and
520 nm, respectively, with a constant bandwidth (5 nm). Pb2+-dependent DNAzyme experiments were carried out in 200 μL of
buffer solution (50 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and
50 mM HEPES at pH 7.2) containing 50 nM substrate, 60 nM enzyme, and
different concentrations of lead acetate (for sensitivity analysis),
and the mixture was equilibrated at room temperature for 30 min prior
to measurement. For the Cu2+-dependent DNAzyme experiment,
the parameters were the same as those for Pb2+, except
that the buffer (50 mM HEPES, 3 M NaCl, and 50 μM ascorbate,
pH 7.0) was different.

Gel Electrophoresis
For Cu2+-dependent L-DNAzyme
activity analysis, six tubes of reaction buffer solution (50 mM HEPES,
3 M NaCl, and 50 μM ascorbate, pH 7.0) containing 5 μM
substrate and 6 μM enzyme (D-E/D-S with or without Cu2+, L-E/L-S with or without Cu2+, D-E/L-S with Cu2+, and L-E/D-S with Cu2+, respectively) were incubated
at room temperature. After 90 min reaction, the mixed solution were
transferred into 15 μL of saturated urea to quench the cleavage
reaction. Then the reaction substrates were separated by 15% denaturing
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by a fluorescence
image scanner (FLA-3000G; Fuji, Tokyo, Japan) using 473 nm excitation.
To monitor FBS digestion of DNAzyme, nine tubes of 5 μM L-S
in 10 μL of FBS were prepared and incubated for 0, 0.5, 1, 2,
4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively, at 37 °C. Afterward, the
samples were incubated at 95 °C for 10 min, and then 15 μL
of saturated urea were added into the sample to deactivate. A 7.5/15%
gradient denaturing polyacrylamide gel was prepared using 1×
TBE buffer (pH 8.3). The gel was run at 120 V for about 1 h in 1×
TBE buffer and analyzed by a fluorescence image scanner.

Cell Culture,
Transfection, and Confocal Imaging
HeLa
cells were cultured in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100
U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C in 95% air,
5% CO2. Transfection experiment was carried out in light
of the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, L-DNAzymes were annealed
by heating to 85 °C for 5 min and cooling to room temperature.
A volume of 5 μL of Lipofectamine 2000 and 1 nmol of annealed
L-DNAzymes were incubated separately in Opti-MEM media containing
50 μM ascorbate for 5 min. After 25 min incubation at room temperature,
the samples was added to HeLa cells for 10 h. Then, 0.2 mM Cu2+ was added, and the results were observed under fluorescence
imaging.

Confocal fluorescence imaging was carried out on a
FV1000 confocal laser-scanning microscope. The images were collected
with different objective lens (40×, UplanApo N.A. 0.95, for Cu2+-DNAzyme; 60×, UplanApo N.A. 1.4, for Pb2+-DNAzyme, Olympus).

Results and Discussion
The sensor
design is shown in Figure S2A. The Cu2+-dependent DNAzyme is a deoxyribonucleotide-based
complex that cleaves separate DNA substrates in the presence of Cu2+.43−45 In order to accurately estimate the catalytic activity
of the enantiomeric L-DNAzymes, we measured the fluorescence of DNAzyme
catalysis using a molecular beacon according to Lu’s report.46 As shown in Figure S2B, the presence of Cu2+ results in irreversible cleavage
of the substrate, leading to fluorescence enhancement.

Circular Dichroism
and Thermodynamics of Enantiomer DNAzymes
To verify the structure
of the two enantiomers, circular dichroism
(CD) spectra were first measured. As shown in Figure 2A, a typical profile for a right-handed DNA
helix was observed from D-DNAzyme with a negative peak at 246 nm and
a positive peak at 278 nm, whereas the nearly inverted mirror spectrum
was observed from L-DNAzyme, indicating that L-DNAzyme was formed
with the left-handed helical property, as expected. In addition, the
thermal stability of the two enantiomers was also investigated. As
shown in Figure 2B,
the melting temperature indicated no apparent difference between L-
and D-DNAzyme, both at approximately 42–44 °C. These results
suggested that the L-DNAzyme was formed as the mirror image of D-DNAzyme.

Figure 2 (A) Circular
dichroism spectra of L- and D-DNAzyme are inverted
images for the two enantiomer DNAzymes. For D-DNAzyme, a negative
peak is around 246 nm, and a positive peak is around 278 nm, while
for L-DNAzyme, a positive peak is around 246 nm, and a negative peak
is around 278 nm. (B) The two enantiomers have similar DNA melting
temperatures at approximately 42–44 °C. FI = fluorescence
intensity.

Catalytic Activity of Enantiomeric
DNAzymes
The catalytic
cleavage activity of the two enantiomeric DNAzymes was confirmed by
gel electrophoresis. As shown in Figure 3A, in the presence or absence Cu2+, the substrate of the D-DNAzyme (D-S) was respectively cleaved (lane
2) or remained intact (lane 1) in accordance with previous reports.43,44 The catalytic activity of the L-DNAzyme is shown in lanes 3 and
4. In the absence of Cu2+ (lane 3), the substrate (L-S)
also remained intact, indicating that no nonspecific cleavage had
occurred. However, upon the addition of Cu2+, L-S was cleaved,
fully confirming L-DNAzyme as the enantiomer of D-DNAzyme and, hence,
having a similar ability to catalyze DNA-cleavage with the help of
the same metal ion cofactor. A real-time fluorescence assay showed
the same results. As illustrated in Figure 3B, using a TaqMan probe with a FAM dye label,
unquenched fluorescence was observed from the solution containing
50 nM L-S. However, upon the addition of 60 nM L-enzyme (L-E), an
immediate decrease of fluorescence intensity occurred, since the residual
fluorescence of FAM was quenched by the nearby quencher, Dabcyl. Next,
30 μM Cu2+ was added into the reaction mixture, resulting
in a remarkable increase of fluorescence signal, which indicated a
successful catalytic cleavage reaction realized by the L-DNAzyme.
Fluorescence titration experiment was also carried out to test the
limit of detection. As shown in Figure S3A, fluorescence intensity increased as the concentration of the Cu2+ increased within the range of 0–30 μM, and
a 10 nM detection limit was estimated in accordance with previous
reports for D-DNAzyme.43,44 Meanwhile, in contrast to Cu2+, no obvious fluorescence change was observed upon the addition
of other metal ions (Cd2+, Co2+, Fe3+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+) with a 10-fold higher concentration (Figure S3B).

with Cu2+. (B) Time course study of Cu2+-dependent
L-DNAzyme in the presence of Cu2+.

Biostability and Activity of L-DNAzymes in Biological Fluids
Next, we investigated whether cross-hybridization, such as D-S/L-E
and L-S/D-E complexes, would catalyze substrate cleavage. As exhibited
in Figure 3A, lanes
5 and 6, in the presence of Cu2+, no cleaved band appeared
in either the D-S/L-E or L-S/D-E reaction mixture. This result might
be attributed to the inability of D-E (or L-E) to hybridize with L-S
(or D-S), respectively,36 as shown in Figure S4A,B, where both D-S and L-S showed unquenched
fluorescence signals in the presence of the enantiomeric enzyme. Therefore,
since L-DNA could not hybridize with D-DNA, the unexpected off-target
effect was avoided. We then demonstrated that the L-DNAzyme could
resist the interference of single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB)
and nuclease. As shown in Figure S4C, while
D-S exhibited a 3.5-fold increase of anisotropy signal in the presence
of SSB, L-S showed no significant change. Finally, the stability of
L-DNA was tested in the presence of nuclease. As shown in Figure S4D, after 1.5 h incubation in DNase I,
the L-DNAzyme remained intact, while the D-DNAzyme had completely
decomposed.

These results all indicate rigid reciprocal chiral
substrate specificity, as previously reported.24,35 More importantly, our data also demonstrated that the metal ion,
i.e., achiral cofactor, could specifically respond to both DNAzyme
enantiomers. Thus, since the biological matrix imposes no restrictions
on nonbiological L-DNAzyme, an interference-free DNAzyme may be proposed
for biological fluids, thereby circumventing the drawbacks of natural
nucleic acids, such as nuclease digestion, protein binding, and undesired
intermolecular interactions with other nucleic acids.

To overcome
the challenges involving interferences that arise from
complex biological matrixes, the L-DNAzyme-based biosensor was first
used to detect Cu2+ in fetal bovine serum (FBS), a complex
biological matrix in which exogenous natural DNAzymes are vulnerable
to enzymatic degradation.47 As exhibited
in Figure 4A, in 90%
FBS, L-S showed negligible digestion, even after incubation for 72
h at 37 °C, indicating its excellent biostability at physiological
temperature. In contrast, D-S was easily hydrolyzed under the same
condition after 2 h (Figure 4B). The activity of L-DNAzyme in FBS was also tested in different
FBS concentrations using gel electrophoresis. As shown in Figure 4C, by increasing
serum concentration from 0 to 50%, the activity of L-DNAzyme remained
unchanged in the reaction buffer since negligible reduction of the
residual band was observed in the presence of Cu2+. We
next applied the stable L-DNAzyme to measure Cu2+ in FBS
using a fluorescence titration assay. As demonstrated in Figure 4D, in the presence
of different Cu2+ concentrations (0, 0.5–30 μM),
the fluorescence intensity of L-DNAzyme increased with elevated Cu2+ concentrations. These results clearly demonstrated that
L-DNAzyme could effectively function in complex biological samples,
indicating its potential for metal ion detection in clinical trials.

(D) Response of L-DNAzyme to different concentrations (0, 0.5, 0.75,
1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 30 μM) of Cu2+ in 10% FBS.

Application of L-DNAzymes
for Intracellular Metal Ion Imaging
After demonstrating that
the L-DNAzyme had unchanged activity and
sensing performance in FBS, we then challenged its ability to sense
Cu2+ in cultured HeLa cells. HeLa cells were first transfected
with Cu2+- (Figure 5, left) or Pb2+- (Figure 5, right) dependent L-DNAzymes for 10 h, respectively,
followed by the addition of Cu2+ and ascorbic acid. As
shown in Figure 5,
in the presence of 0.2 mM Cu2+ and 50 μM ascorbic
acid, the confocal image showed a bright fluorescence signal. In contrast,
only negligible fluorescence intensity change was observed within
45 min after treatment with Pb2+-dependent DNAzyme, indicating
that L-DNAzyme could be used for intracellular monitoring of metal
ions with high specificity.

transfected with Cu2+- (left) or Pb2+- (right)
dependent L-DNAzyme

ascorbate.

Generality: Pb2+-dependent Enantiomer DNAzymes
Thus far, on the basis of
chiral specificity, it has been proved
that the Cu2+-dependent mirror-image enantiomer of D-DNAzyme,
L-DNAzyme, could catalyze Cu2+-dependent DNA cleavage,
thus showing its potential for sensing and imaging of Cu2+ in both serum and living cells. To further illustrate that this
chiral specificity is universal in the DNAzyme system, we investigated
the applicability of this method to other DNAzymes for the detection
of their corresponding target metal ions. The Pb2+-dependent
GR-5 DNAzyme was chosen, which selectively employs Pb2+ as the metal cofactor to catalyze and cleave a DNA/RNA chimera substrate
at the “rA” site (Figure S5).48−50 The activity of GR-5 L-DNAzyme was also confirmed
by gel electrophoresis. As exhibited in the inset of Figure 6A, L-S was cleaved when Pb2+ added, resulting in disappearance of its band mostly, demonstrated
that the GR-5 L-DNAzyme has the predicted ability to catalyze Pb2+-dependent substrate cleavage. Fluorescence assay was also
used to accurately estimate the catalytic activity, as a result, an
11-fold signal increase was observed after the addition of 5 μM
Pb2+ in the buffer (Figure 6B). The stability was also demonstrated by incubation
of the GR-5 L-S in DNase I solution for 1.5 h (Figure 6A, lane 3, no digestion of the L-S was observed).
Meanwhile, it can also resist undesired intermolecular interactions
(Figure S6A,B) and SSB nonspecific binding
(Figure S6C). Since Pb2+-dependent
GR-5 L-DNAzyme could perform as well as its enantiomer,49 it can be suggested that chiral specificity
is universal in the DNAzyme system.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the enantiomer
of D-DNAzyme, L-DNAzyme, could initiate
catalytic cleavage activity with the same achiral metal ion as a cofactor
based on reciprocal chiral substrate specificity. By using L-DNAzyme
as recognition units, a facile and stable L-DNAzyme sensor was proposed
for sensing metal ions in biological samples. Taking Cu2+- and Pb2+-dependent L-DNAzymes as two examples, the results
showed that the enantiomer DNAzymes possessed similar catalytic activity.
Furthermore, since L-DNAzyme was not influenced by nucleases, natural
proteins, or D-nucleic acids, it could be used in complex biological
fluids, such as serum and living cells, for quantitative determination
of metal ions, indicating that L-DNAzyme can circumvent many challenges
associated with metal ion detection in complex biological matrixes.
Thus, the ability to recognize metal ions from the enantiomer of D-DNAzyme
offers an exciting way to design DNAzymes, which will not only provide
new schemes to utilize L-DNAzyme for bioanalysis but also inspire
the generation of new DNAzymes for a variety of biomedical applications.
