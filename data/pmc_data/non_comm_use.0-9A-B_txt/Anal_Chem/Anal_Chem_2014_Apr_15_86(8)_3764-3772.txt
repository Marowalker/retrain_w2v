Accurate
and rapid assessment of the healing status of a wound in a simple
and noninvasive manner would enable clinicians to diagnose wounds
in real time and promptly adjust treatments to hasten the resolution
of nonhealing wounds. Histologic and biochemical characterization
of biopsied wound tissue, which is currently the only reliable method
for wound assessment, is invasive, complex to interpret, and slow.
Here we demonstrate the use of Raman microspectroscopy coupled with
multivariate spectral analysis as a simple, noninvasive method to
biochemically characterize healing wounds in mice and to accurately
identify different phases of healing of wounds at different time-points.
Raman spectra were collected from “splinted” full thickness
dermal wounds in mice at 4 time-points (0, 1, 5, and 7 days) corresponding
to different phases of wound healing, as verified by histopathology.
Spectra were deconvolved using multivariate factor analysis (MFA)
into 3 “factor score spectra” (that act as spectral
signatures for different stages of healing) that were successfully
correlated with spectra of prominent pure wound bed constituents (i.e.,
collagen, lipids, fibrin, fibronectin, etc.) using non-negative least squares
(NNLS) fitting. We show that the factor loadings (weights) of spectra
that belonged to wounds at different time-points provide a quantitative
measure of wound healing progress in terms of key parameters such
as inflammation and granulation. Wounds at similar stages of healing
were characterized by clusters of loading values and slowly healing
wounds among them were successfully identified as “outliers”.
Overall, our results demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can be used
as a noninvasive technique to provide insight into the status of normally
healing and slow-to-heal wounds and that it may find use as a complementary
tool for real-time, in situ biochemical characterization
in wound healing studies and clinical diagnosis.

==== Body
Nearly 6.5 million people in the
United States suffer from chronic wounds leading to annual treatment
costs that exceed $25 billion.1 A wide
variety of treatment options exist,2 but
finding a specific treatment that is effective for each wound is challenging.
Clinicians often try multiple treatments until one is found that promotes
the healing process for a particular patient. Analytical technologies
and methods that would allow the clinician to accurately and quickly
assess the status of a wound to assist in targeting therapy would
be a significant contribution to clinical wound management.

In concept, wound healing is thought to occur in distinct, overlapping
stages; it begins with hemostasis, is followed by a stage in which
inflammation is prevalent, which in turn leads to a stage where formation
of granulation tissue, cell proliferation, angiogenesis and re-epithelialization
are dominant.3 Nonhealing or slowly healing
(dysregulated or chronic) wounds are frequently characterized as being
stuck in a persistent, inflammatory stage, unable to make a transition
to the cell-proliferative stage. The evaluation of nonhealing wounds
is difficult, however, and is usually performed qualitatively based
on gross visual examination4 that requires
high clinical skill and experience.5 It
may also sometimes require biopsies at multiple locations of a wound
with concomitant wait for histological analyses.6 A simple and fast method that characterizes healing progress
in a wound has the potential to expedite clinical assessment, better
inform treatment, ultimately reducing discomfort and promoting favorable
wound healing outcomes for patients.

Several noninvasive, optical
methods have shown promise for characterization of the physical properties
of wounds in vivo such as cutaneous blood flow with
assessment of wound microcirculation (laser Doppler perfusion imaging),
tissue structure (optical coherence tomography), and tissue temperature
(thermal imaging).7 Currently, however,
biochemical characteristics of healing wound beds can reliably be
evaluated only by tissue biopsy followed by histology or chemical
analysis.8 In addition to being invasive,
this method is tedious, laborious,9 and
subjective.10 Raman spectroscopy, in contrast,
holds the potential to provide a simple and rapid method that permits
assessment of the biochemistry of a wound bed in situ and thus an alternative to traditional approaches to the biochemical
evaluation of wounds that are based on biopsied tissue or wound fluids.11 Raman spectroscopy relies on the inelastic (Raman)
scattering of photons incident on a material. While most of the incident
light is scattered elastically (without change in wavenumber), a small
fraction (10–4 to 10–3 of the
incident light intensity) is scattered inelastically with altered
wavenumbers and these alterations (known as Raman shifts) correspond
to transitions between rotational or vibrational energy levels of
chemical bonds.12 The Raman scattered light
can be used to identify the chemical functional groups of a material.13 Various biological tissues have been analyzed
by Raman spectroscopy and shown to identify diseased tissue in ailments
such as breast cancer,14 atherosclerosis,15 cervical precancer,16 and Alzheimer’s disease,17 to
name a few. Prior studies18−21 have reported Raman spectra of wounds but no study
has demonstrated the use of the method to distinguish between different
stages of wound healing in vivo. In particular, we
comment that past analyses of Raman spectra of in vivo wounds have been based on differences in individual Raman peaks
or peak ratios that were assigned to specific proteins.18−20 This approach is limited in diagnostic utility with complex biological
tissue because many different tissue components are derived from common
molecular structural units (amino-acids, sugars, fatty acids) and
bonds. In contrast, we demonstrate that Raman spectra can provide
useful biochemical insights into wound healing when peak locations
and intensities are considered in aggregate across the entire Raman
spectrum. Multivariate statistics, as used in our study, enable the
evaluation of aggregate differences in spectra across a wide wavenumber
range resulting in a “spectral signature” characteristic
of individual phases of the wound healing process. Our study employs
Raman spectroscopy in a well-characterized animal wound model, the
excisional “splinted” wound in the mouse that mimics
the healing of full-thickness wounds in humans.22 We demonstrate a methodology to distinguish between different
stages of wound healing on the basis of an aggregate of biochemical
markers (associated with the different stages) that are identified
by Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra that are collected from a wound
are subjected to multivariate factor analysis (MFA) to yield analogous
factor “loadings” which serve as objective, quantitative
measures in the assessment of healing of the wounds.

In the
remainder of this paper, we first discuss differences in averaged
Raman spectra collected from wounds at different time-points by assigning
peak locations and areas to chemical bonds that correspond to amino-acids
or protein secondary structures. Second, we employ multivariate factor
analysis (MFA)23,24 to interpret the Raman spectra
and distinguish between the different phases of wound healing in a
quantitative and objective manner. This approach is complemented by
histopathologic imaging of biopsied tissue. Third, we show that the
abstract factors obtained from MFA can be correlated to major wound
bed constituents that are associated with the different phases using
non-negative least squares (NNLS) fitting of the factor score spectra
with basis spectra. Fourth, we show that variability in healing between
wounds in different mice can be quantified with the help of MFA and “outlier”
(slow-to-heal) wounds can also be identified, and we further confirm
our results using histopathologic analysis.

Materials and Methods
Creation
of Full Thickness Dermal Wounds in Mice and Harvesting of Wounds
All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. BalbC
mice (Jackson Laboratories, Inc., Bar Harbor, ME) between the ages
of 8 to 16 weeks were used for the studies. Please refer to the Supporting Information for details on mice upkeep.
Mice were anesthetized with 2% inhaled isoflurane, administered using
an induction chamber. The mice were injected with buprenorphine (0.001
mg) for analgesia prior to wounding. Mice were shaved on the cranial
dorsal region and back nails trimmed. Shaved area was aseptically
prepped with Betasept Scrub (4% chlorhexidine gluconate) and sterile
saline (0.9%) 3 times each using sterile cotton tipped applicators.
Silicone splints (11 mm × 1.75 mm O-ring, O-Ring Warehouse no.
0568-013) were glued to the skin, one on each side of the midline
with CrazyGlue Gel. Six simple interrupted sutures were placed with
5-0 nylon suture (Monosef, Covidien or Ethilon; Ethicon) with the
suture equidistant around the O-ring. Two 6 mm wounds, one within
each splinted skin area, were created using a 6 mm biopsy punch (Milltex,
Inc., Plainsboro, NJ). For wounds not being harvested at the initial
time point, a 14 mm plastic coverslip was glued to the splint with
CrazyGlue Gel and then covered with Tegaderm (3M). Mice were recovered
from anesthesia on a warming pad until ambulatory and then returned
to the colony. Upon completion of each time point, the mice were euthanized
with an intraperitoneal injection of Beuthanasia-D (Schering-Plough,
Kenilworth, NJ) solution (0.5 mL per mouse) after induction of anesthesia
as described above.

Wounds were harvested for collection of
Raman spectra and histopathologic analysis using iris scissors and
eye dressing forceps. A square of tissue was cut around the outside
of the O-ring and placed in a tissue cassette for later placement
in 10% formalin. Please refer to the Supporting
Information for detailed methods for histopathologic analyses
of the wounds.

Experiments were repeated on four separate batches
of mice (designated as WT1 to WT4 in the manuscript) at different
times following the same protocol as above. Histopathologic analysis
was performed on all mice wounds belonging to batches WT3 and WT4.
In batch WT2, histopathologic analysis was performed on half of the
wounds and Raman spectra was collected from the other half of the
wounds. Table 1 indicates the no. of mice
in different batches assigned for harvesting of wounds at different
time-points.

Raman Spectral Analysis
A confocal Raman microscope (Thermo Fisher Raman DXR) with a 10×
objective (N.A. 0.25) and a laser wavelength of 532 nm (10 mW of power
at sampling point) was used to collect spectra. The estimated spot
size on the sample was 2.1 μm and resolution was 2.7–4
cm–1. The confocal aperture used was a 25 μm
pinhole, and spectra between wavenumbers 500–3500 cm–1 were collected. A total of 5–6 spectra were collected from
6 different points across the surface of the wound bed (top left,
top right, one or two from the center, bottom left, bottom right,
see Figure S-1 in the Supporting Information). In general, spectra acquired from distinct spatial locations differed
from each other, reflecting spatial heterogeneity on the wound bed
surface (see Figure S-2 in the Supporting Information). As discussed below, we averaged these spectra in the study reported
in this paper. The collection time for each spectrum was around 5
min. Spectra were also collected for 7 pure components: bovine collagen
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), bovine elastin (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO), hyaluronic acid (Lifecore Biomedical, Chaska, MN), fibronectin
(Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA), fibrin (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO), mouse blood drawn as per approved protocol (Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee, University of Wisconsin-Madison), and
triolein (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for comparison to the spectra
obtained from the wound beds. Proprietary features available in OMNIC
(Thermo Scientific) software were used to remove background fluorescence
from all the spectra using polynomial baseline fitting (6th order)
and to normalize the spectra. As mentioned above, spectra collected
from different locations on a particular wound were averaged to represent
an individual wound. The spectra representing individual wounds characterized
on the same day were averaged again so that each day (day 0/1/5/7)
was represented by one spectrum (see Figure 2). The standard deviation for these spectra has been presented in
Figure S-3 (in the Supporting Information). An analysis of peak areas and peak locations was performed for
these averaged spectra, and the spectral peaks were curve-fitted and
analyzed for peak positions and peak areas using Fityk.25

Multivariate factor analysis was performed
on all spectra representing individual wounds using XLSTAT version
2013.1.02 (MS Excel add-in) to express the spectra as a weighted sum
of 3 “factor score spectra” with the weights termed
as “factor loadings”. Please refer to the Supporting Information (Multivariate Factor Analysis
section) for more details.

Factor scores were also normalized
and scaled to convert them into “factor score spectra”
which were fitted with real spectra belonging to the 7 different wound
bed constituents using Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS) analysis
using MATLAB (v. R2012b) to correlate the factor score spectra with
spectra of the 7 pure wound bed constituents. The degree of orthogonality
between the spectra of pure wound bed constituents was also calculated
to establish the differences between them (refer to the Supporting Information for details). The degree
of orthogonality was calculated between different pairs of the basis
spectra using MATLAB and it was determined to range between 0.38 and
0.94 (see Table S-1 in the Supporting Information). For the NNLS analysis, R2 (coefficient
of multiple correlation) > 0.9 for all factor score spectra. A
Ryan-Einot-Gabriel-Welsch Q multiple comparison test (REGWQ test,
ANOVA) for determining the significance of differences (confidence
interval, 95%) between sets of factor loading values for wounds on
different days was also performed and the results are presented in
Table S-2 (in the Supporting Information).

Results
Analysis of Averaged Raman Spectra of Mice
Wounds on Days 0, 1, 5 and 7
On the basis of prior histopathologic
analysis of full thickness murine wounds in our laboratory, we chose
4 time-points (0, 1, 5, and 7 days) at which to collect Raman spectra
from wounds to characterize biochemical changes that occur as wounds
progress through different stages of healing (hemostasis, inflammation,
granulation/proliferation). Figure 1 shows
representative images of splinted wound beds obtained at the different
time-points. The appearance of the wound bed surface in all the wounds
varied little at different time-points, except for a slight increase
in size from day 0 to day 1 and then a marked reduction in wound size
by the seventh day. Histopathologic scores for inflammation and granulation
were consistent with the wounds at different times corresponding to
different stages of healing (see below and refer to the Supporting Information for Figures S-4 to S-7
and Table S-3).

Figure 1 ‘Splinted’ wounds in mice on (A) day 0,
(B) day 1, (C) day 5, and (D) day 7. Scale bar = 1 mm.

Figure 2 shows the Raman spectra of the wounds at the different time
points (refer to Table S-4 in the Supporting Information for a detailed summary of peak locations and areas). The prominent
Raman peaks in the spectra can be grouped into three categories: (i)
peaks related to the strong amide I (WN, 1620–1680 cm–1) and amide III (WN, 1220–1270 cm–1) vibrational
modes for the peptide backbone, which indicate different protein secondary
structures,26 (ii) peaks that correspond
to specific side-chains for specific amino-acids (WN, 674, 749, 785,
826, 851, 1003, 1030, 1172, 1338, 1360, 1398, 1585, 1606 cm–1) making up the proteins,27 and (iii)
peaks corresponding to the −CH stretching region at higher
wavenumbers (WN, 2700–3100 cm–1) which indicate
relative quantities of total protein and lipid.28 From these groupings, we make three observations. First,
the decrease in areas of multiple peaks corresponding to α-helical
secondary structure (WN, 1267, 1655 cm–1) and a
simultaneous increase in areas for peaks representing β-sheets
(WN, 1223, 1623, 1638 cm–1) and random coils (WN,
1244, 1671 cm–1) across the Amide I and Amide III
vibrational regions indicate the deposition of new proteins on a wound
bed which initially contained residual ECM collagen (α-helical).
Fibrin, collagen type III, fibronectin, elastin, hyaluronic acid,
and cells and proteins in blood plasma are generally the major constituents
of granulation tissue that forms on the wound bed in the course of
healing. Fibrin is a key protein forming the blood clot and granulation
tissue and has high nonhelical (β-sheet + random coil ∼80%)
secondary structure content.29 Fibronectin
is another key protein that forms the provisional matrix on a wound
during the first week of wound repair,30 and it also has a high content (∼80%) of β-sheets (WN,
1637, 1679, 1225 cm–1) in particular.31 Second, most peaks which correspond to amino
acids (WN, 674, 749, 785, 1003, 1360 cm–1) are observed
to have a 2–4-fold increase in area, and this is again consistent
with protein accumulation on the wound bed. Third, peak areas that
are lipid specific (WN, 2852, 2933, 3010 cm–1) are
reduced 1–4-fold with time and those that are protein-specific
(WN, 2897, 2968, 3062 cm–1) are increased 1–3-fold.
This result is consistent with subcutaneous fat (that is exposed when
a full-thickness wound is created) being overlaid with granulation
tissue. We note, however, that many peak locations suffer from redundancy
of assignment (as seen in Table S-4 in the Supporting
Information) and individual peaks cannot be assigned with certainty
to specific ECM proteins on the wound bed. Consequently, as detailed
below, we sought to employ multivariate statistical methods to distinguish
between wound spectra based on aggregate differences measured across
a wide wavenumber range.

0 (n = 30), day 1 (n = 36), day
5 (n = 23), and day 7 (n = 23).

Multivariate Factor Analysis
(MFA) of the Spectral Data Set and Non-Negative Least-Squares (NNLS)
Fitting of Factor Score Spectra
As described in the Materials and Methods section, we used multivariate
factor analysis (MFA)23,24 to analyze the spectral data.
Our goal was to test the hypothesis that changes in composition of
a wound that accompany changes in the stage of healing give rise to
Raman spectra that can be deciphered using MFA to yield unique spectral
signatures that form underlying basis Raman spectra for each stage
of healing. Eigenanalysis of the correlation matrix formed from the
spectral data matrix revealed that there were three eigenvectors whose
eigenvalues were greater than 1 (see Figure S-8 (scree plot) in the Supporting Information) and that 99% of the variability
in the spectral data set could be expressed in terms of them. However,
the factors calculated initially from the eigenvector matrix were
orthogonal and therefore uncorrelated. Our next goal was to identify
factors which would not necessarily be uncorrelated but could model
the levels of biochemical constituents associated with the different
stages of healing (which are correlated) and would resemble non-negative,
real spectra. We therefore relaxed the orthogonality constraint and
performed oblique rotations of the factor axes (Promax rotation32) which increases the simplicity of interpretation,33 makes each variable (wound spectrum) identify
with one or a small proportion of the factors (and thus enable clustering
of similar variables on basis of their factor loadings),24 spreads the variance across factors more evenly,24 and generates an invariant factor solution24 (that does not depend on the particular mix
of variables involved and is generalizable across experiments). We
found that the resulting factor score “spectra” were
able to resemble non-negative, “real” spectra (see Figure
S-9 in the Supporting Information) and
we hypothesized that these could be assigned as spectral signatures
for the different stages of healing. We verified this prediction by
obtaining a high degree of fit between each factor score spectrum
and spectra obtained from pure wound bed constituents using non-negative
least-squares fitting (results described further below).

Figure 3A shows the factor scores (scaled and normalized)
obtained from MFA plotted against wavenumber. Figure 3B shows averaged factor loading values for all wounds harvested
at a particular time-point. A distinct pattern of factor loading values
can be observed for each time-point (values sum to 1 at each time-point)
which in turn corresponds to different stages of wound healing. While
factor 1 loading is seen to decrease with time, factor 2 and factor
3 loadings conversely increase with time. We speculated that factor
1 is likely correlated with the fresh state of a wound whereas factors
2 and 3 probably represent the accumulation of cells and proteins
that are associated with inflammatory stage and deposition of granulation
tissue, respectively. Consistent with our hypothesis, Figure 3B shows that the average loading value for factor
1 is reduced by 50% (from 0.84 ± 0.03 to 0.41 ± 0.05) and
factor 2 is increased 6–7-fold (from 0.07 ± 0.02 to 0.48
± 0.05) between day 0 and day 1. On day 5, the factor 1 loading
value is reduced even further to 15% of its initial value (from 0.84
± 0.03 to 0.13 ± 0.03), factor 2 remains the same, and factor
3 loading increases 4-fold (from 0.1 ± 0.02 to 0.42 ± 0.06).
The day 7 factor loadings were not found to be significantly different
from day 5 (for details, refer to Table S-2 (Supporting
Information)) except for a decrease in factor 2 loadings (to
0.27 ± 0.05).

MFA and (B) average factor loadings from MFA (normalized and scaled).
Error bars indicate ±SEM. (C) Standardized regression coefficients
of model basis spectra of wound bed constituents for the factor score
spectra.

On the basis of the above observations,
we sought to determine if it was possible to associate each factor
score spectrum to real wound bed constituents that are typically present
during the course of healing. Our model consisted of basis spectra
from 7 major wound bed constituents (see Figure S-10 for basis spectra
and Table S-5 for their Raman bands in the Supporting
Information), and the factor score spectra could be depicted
as an aggregate of these basis spectra with a high degree of fit (R2 values > 0.90) using Non-Negative Least
Squares (NNLS) analysis. Figure 3C shows the
standardized regression coefficients (RC) for the basis spectra which
collectively sum to 1 for each factor score spectrum. Figure 3C indicates that Factor 1 score spectrum has strong
contributions from collagen (RC, 0.52) and triolein (RC, 0.44; a triglyceride
that mimics subcutaneous fat34), components
that correlate strongly to the fresh state of a full-thickness wound
bed. Factor 2 score spectrum has high contributions from blood (RC,
0.50, which contains inflammatory cells) and fibrin (RC, 0.26), components
that represent inflammation on the wound bed as healing progresses35 and minor contributions from triolein (RC, 0.12),
elastin (RC, 0.1), hyaluronic acid (RC, 0.01), and fibronectin (RC,
0.01). Factor 3 score spectrum has strong contributions from fibrin
(RC, 0.54), elastin (RC, 0.24), hyaluronic acid (RC, 0.1), and fibronectin
(RC, 0.1) all of which are key components of granulation tissue on
the wound bed and reflect a high proclivity of the wound toward cell
proliferation which would lead to wound closure.35

Distinction between Individual Wounds on
the Basis of Factor Loading Values
MFA enables a simple way
to quantify the variability among the different spectra by comparing
factor loading values. Here we show that this can be used to distinguish
between individual wounds in different healing stages. Figure 4 shows the clustering of wounds (from the experiment
on the batch of mice “WT3”) which belong to similar
stages of healing based on their factor loadings. They are plotted
graphically in a 3D graph where the axes represent two of the factors,
and the size of circles belonging to different wounds represents the
third factor. While all wounds harvested on day 0 were similar to
each other in their spectra and hence had loading values close to
each other, 4 wounds from later time-points (day 1 and day 7) behaved
as “outliers” whose loading values corresponded to earlier
time points (day 0 or day 1 respectively) and are highlighted with
solid red labels in Figure 4. Specifically,
the outlier wound for the set of wounds harvested on day 7 (WT3 Day
7 S13) has low factor 1 and factor 3 loading values (0.132 and 0.355,
respectively) but a high factor 2 loading value (0.554). We compared
this observation with histopathologic imaging of the wound sections
(see Figure 5E,F) which also shows the “outlier”
wound to be exhibit reduced healing in terms of granulation scores
and re-epithelialization (which we have associated earlier with factor
3 on basis of NNLS fitting) but has high inflammation (associated
with factor 2). Again, three wounds were evaluated as outliers among
those harvested on Day 1 (WT3 Day 1 S6, S9, and S10) with high factor
1 loading values and low factor 2 and 3 loading values. This is consistent
with histopathologic images of sections from 2 out of the 3 wounds
(WT3 Day 1 S6 and S9; see Figure 5A–D)
which indicate an inflammation score that is lower than typical day
1 wounds and an overall appearance similar to day 0 wounds. The clustering
of wounds on the basis of their healing states was broadly consistent
across the multiple groups used in repeat experiments (see Figure
S-11 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 4 Wounds cluster
around three sets of factor loadings (based on Raman spectroscopic
characterization) which represent different stages of healing. The
axes represent factors 1 and 2 while the third factor is represented
by the size of the circles. The wounds represented in this graph were
from a single experiment (WT3) involving 12–14 wounds (S1–S14;
created in 6–7 mice) that were characterized at each time-point
(Day 0/Day 1/Day 7). Outliers indicate slowly healing wounds and are
marked with red boxed labels. All the wounds were analyzed using histopathology.

Discussion
When a full-thickness dermal wound is initially
created in mice, subcutaneous fat and residual ECM collagen is exposed
and composes the starting wound bed surface. Significant biochemical
changes occur on the wound bed within the first day of wounding, when
hemostasis is established and an inflammatory response is mounted.36 As a result, a provisional matrix principally
made up of fibrin and fibronectin is deposited on the wound bed that
is infiltrated with inflammatory cells (neutrophils, macrophages)
and burst platelets from blood. While this wound bed activity is not
apparent by gross physical appearance of the wounds alone (see Figure 1A,B), it is evidenced in the notable differences
in factor loading values obtained from Raman spectra between day 0
and day 1 (see Figure 3B), a decrease in factor
1 (associated with subcutaneous fat and residual ECM collagen) by
50% and an increase in factor 2 (associated principally with fibrin
and blood) by 6–7-fold. The provisional matrix so formed is
subsequently infiltrated by fibroblasts and remodeled into granulation
tissue (which contains wound bed constituents such as hyaluronic acid,
fibronectin, elastin, and collagen type III) while inflammation subsides.
This activity is manifested in the changes to factor loading values
as well, factor 2 decreases by day 7, factor 3 (associated principally
with fibrin, fibronectin, hyaluronan, and elastin) increases progressively,
and there is an increase in factor 1 (associated with collagen) also
by day 7. Thus the 3 factors used to describe the spectra in our study
successfully permit identification of the phase of healing for a particular
wound on the basis of changes in quantities of underlying biochemical
components. However, we note that NNLS fitting of factor score spectra
with basis spectra can be improved further and higher R2-values could potentially be achieved by increasing the
number of basis components in our model. This issue will be addressed
in future studies. We also note that in past studies,18,20,37 analyses of Raman spectra of
tissue have often relied upon band area ratios or band areas in the
fingerprint (600–1800 cm–1) and CH-stretching
(2800–3100 cm–1) region. However, such analyses
did not prove sufficient for us to be able to uniquely identify the
stages of healing in different wounds (see Table S-6 in the Supporting Information). For example, the band
ratio 1665 cm–1/1445 cm–1 which
has been reported20 to be indicative of
collagen/total protein content does not permit identification of the
stage of healing of the wound on different days; its values on day
1 (0.62) and day 7 (0.62) are the same. However, factor analysis is
able to capture the differences between the spectra of those days
as reflected in the average factor loadings (see Figure 3B).

The results presented in Figure 4 also indicate that wounds in individual mice with different
extents of progress in their healing form distinct clusters on the
basis of their factor loading values. The cluster analysis also identified
“outlier” wounds which we hypothesized to indicate impairment
in their healing, as murine wound healing progress is known to vary
across individual mice.38 Three out of
four outlier wounds so identified could be associated with altered
histopathologic profiles (see Figure 5). We
note that histopathologic analysis suffers from a limitation of not
always being representative of the entire wound, as it is based on
microscopic examination of one section of the wound (passing through
the central region of a wound). In our approach, spectra were collected
from 5 to 6 different locations (size ∼10 μm2) distributed across each wound and were averaged to represent the
entire wound (size ∼20 mm2). Our approach was designed
for rapid collection of spectra from each wound bed surface (due to
the large number of total wounds investigated). It is noteworthy that
the factor loading values could still indicate the progress in healing
of the wounds very well (see Figure 3B). However,
the spatial heterogeneity of a wound is also an important aspect of
healing, and a Raman imaging approach could be used to create a map
of biochemical features across a wound and to evaluate spatial differences
in healing. This approach may lead to practical advantages in the
clinic by informing selective therapeutic interventions such as discrete
partial wound debridement that selectively targets areas of impaired
healing while not disturbing areas of a wound that are progressing
satisfactorily. Here we note also that it may be advantageous in future
experiments to use a fiber optic sampler to enable (i) acquisition
of Raman spectra directly from wounds in live animals and (ii) sampling
of a larger fraction of the wound area. Finally, we comment that the
predictive value of histopathologic assessments of inflammation and
granulation tissue formation is diminished due to the inherent subjective
and qualitative nature of the assessment technique.10 In contrast, our approach provides an objective and semiquantitative
measure of the healing progress in terms of factor loading values
which are predictive of the healing status of the wound bed.

Conclusion
In summary, we have shown that the progress and stage of healing
of wounds can be accurately evaluated in terms of biochemical changes
occurring on the wound bed in a simple, noninvasive manner that combines
Raman spectroscopy and spectral analysis. Specifically, we quantitatively
tracked wound healing progress in terms of changes in key biochemical
constituent that underlie the different stages of wound healing (e.g.,
inflammation and granulation) with the help of MFA/NNLS of Raman spectra
obtained from murine full thickness dermal wounds. Furthermore, we
demonstrated that we could distinguish between individual wounds at
different stages of healing, including normally healing and slow-to-heal
wounds. The results presented in this paper enable future studies
of the biochemistry of a broad range of wound bed models (animal models,
chronic wounds, wounds with biofilms). The results also offer substantial
potential for translation to clinical practice, where wounds would
be evaluated noninvasively by hand-held Raman spectrometers in conjunction
with spectral analysis.
