Pores with undulating opening diameters
have emerged as an analytical
tool enhancing the speed of resistive-pulse experiments, with a potential
to simultaneously characterize size and mechanical properties of translocating
objects. In this work, we present a detailed study of the characteristics
of resistive-pulses of charged and uncharged polymer particles in
pores with different aspect ratios and pore topography. Although no
external pressure difference was applied, our experiments and modeling
indicated the existence of local pressure drops, which modified axial
and radial velocities of the solution. As a consequence of the complex
velocity profiles, pores with undulating pore diameter and low-aspect
ratio exhibited large dispersion of the translocation times. Distribution
of the pulse amplitude, which is a measure of the object size, was
not significantly affected by the pore topography. The importance
of tuning pore geometry for the application in resistive-sensing and
multipronged characterization of physical properties of translocating
objects is discussed.

==== Body
Transport
of particles and molecules
can be induced by an external electric field, pressure difference,
or a combination of both. Passage of single particles through a pore
causes a transient change of the pore resistance, called a resistive
pulse.1,2 The resistive pulse technique has been applied
to detect a wide range of molecules and particles.3−14

When the species to be detected carries a net charge, its
translocation
in the external electric field can occur by electrophoresis. However,
if the pore walls are charged, an applied voltage also causes electroosmotic
flow of the whole solution. Thus, the translocation velocity is a
superposition of electrophoretic and electroosmotic velocities.15 Depending on the relative zeta potentials of
the particles and the pore walls, the particles will follow either
the direction of electroosmosis or electrophoresis.16 The dependence of transport on particle charge has prompted
the application of these electrokinetic phenomena for the detection
of single molecules of DNA, proteins, viruses, and particles.9−14,17,18

The resistive pulse profile is intimately related to the velocity
profile in the pore, which sometimes complicates its interpretation.
There are two limiting cases where the velocity profile does not exhibit
significant radial dependence: (1) Electrophoretic transport in an
uncharged ideal cylindrically shaped pore subjected to sufficiently
high voltages to make diffusion of the particles negligible.15,19,20 (2) Electroosmotic flow in a
cylindrical pore with charged walls and with a radius many times the
thickness of the electrical double layer. Under these conditions,
electroosmosis can be described by a plug-flow with constant velocity,
decaying sharply to zero at the walls due to the nonslip boundary
condition.19−25 Most pore based detection platforms often operate at one of these
limiting cases to ease interpretation of the resulting ion current
profile. Undulating pores operate between these regimes and have emerged
as a promising platform capable of probing not only size but also
mechanical properties of translocating particles, as shown before
with hydrogels.26 The pores were also shown
to enhance the speed of resistive-pulse analysis due to the ability
to distinguish single versus few particles residing in the pore at
the same time.29 However, the pulse characteristics
become quite complex and require detailed understanding of velocity
profiles within the pore for proper extraction of material properties
from the ion current signature.

We present here for the first
time a detailed analysis of resistive
pulses obtained with pores whose opening diameter varies along the
pore axis. We performed both experiments and numerical modeling to
elucidate the relationship between velocity profiles in the pores
and the measured ion current. Single polymer pores with an average
opening diameter between 1 and 15 μm were used to examine electrophoretic
and electroosmotic transport of polystyrene particles. The pores were
prepared in polyethylene terephthalate films (PET) by the track-etching
technique and exhibit an undulating diameter along the pore axis.27,28 Topography of each pore can be gleaned from the shape of resistive
pulses.26,29,30 When a particle
passes through a region with a narrower local diameter, the current
decrease will be larger compared to the case when the particle passes
through a wider region. Large variations in the current amplitude
within a resistive pulse indicate existence of large modulations of
the pore diameter along the axis. In this manuscript, we provide experimental
evidence that translocation times in pores with irregular longitudinal
profiles are characterized by a larger variability compared to those
in smoother pores. This effect is especially pronounced in structures
with an aspect ratio less than four. The findings are in agreement
with modeling showing the assumption of the plug-flow is not valid
for pores characterized by a variable charge of the pore walls and/or
variable cross-section area along the pore axis.19,20,31−39 We modeled velocity and pressure profiles in pores with an undulating
opening diameter by numerically solving the coupled Poisson-Nernst–Planck
and Navier–Stokes equations. The modeling confirmed the velocity
of fluid and consequently the velocity of the particles depend on
both a radial position as well as the position along the pore axis.
We believe this will allow the accurate interpretation of ionic current
profiles obtained from pores with undulating diameters. Moreover,
we have also shown the resulting inhomogeneous pressure drops and
velocities do not adversely affect soft particles such as cells. Pores
with undulating diameters have the potential to move the use of resistive
pulse technique beyond mere sizing of particles, enabling the use
of these structures for enhanced biomolecule detection.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of Pores
Single pores in 12, 36, and 50
μm thick films of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were prepared
by the track-etching technique.27 The films
were irradiated with single energetic heavy ions (e.g., 11.4 MeV/u
Au and U ions) at the UNILAC linear accelerator of the GSI Helmholtz
Center for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. Wet chemical
etching of the films in 0.5 M NaOH, 70 °C, and in 2 M NaOH, 60
°C leads to preparation of pores with undulating pore diameter
along the pore axis.28,29 Both etching conditions were
used in this project. The mean pore diameter was estimated from the
current–voltage measurements performed in 1 M KCl and calculating
the pore diameter from its conductance. Experiments presented here
were performed with pores with an average opening diameter between
1 and 15 μm. The walls of track-etched PET pores contain carboxyl
groups and are negatively charged at pH values above 3.8.40

Ion Current Recordings
Single pore
membranes were placed
between two chambers of a homemade conductivity cell filled with an
aqueous solution of KCl either 0.1 M or 10 mM. Home-made Ag/AgCl electrodes
were used in the measurements. Signals of ion current in time were
recorded using two amplifiers. The first one, the commercially available
Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices, Inc.), is limited to measuring currents
below 200 nA, thus was used for pores with an opening diameter smaller
than ∼1.5 μm in 0.1 M KCl and smaller than 4 μm
in 10 mM KCl. Ion currents through pores with a larger opening diameter
was recorded using a custom designed CMOS chip based potentiostat
capable of measuring sub-nA currents on a μA baseline.41 A schematic of the circuit used is shown in
Figure 1. Briefly the circuit enhances small
signals by canceling the static baseline current utilizing a combination
of nonlinear analog processing, oversampled A/D conversion, and digital
signal processing. The removal of the baseline allows for a large
dynamic range while simultaneously reducing the shot noise due to
the baseline current further enhancing detection. The feedback also
removes the slow baseline drift and any 1/f noise
present in the signal up to the feedback filter bandwidth. Because
of the nonlinear front-end and digital feedback loop, sudden changes,
which normally would lead to saturation, can be quickly corrected.41

Figure 1 Schematic of the custom designed amplifier circuit. The
circuit
enables sensing small currents on a large baseline by utilizing baseline
cancellation. In this topology the current is compressed using the
transistor nonlinearity to prevent the circuit from saturating. The
resulting signal is digitized and converted into a 1-bit digital signal
using an oversampled A/D converter (ΣΔ). The baseline
is extracted from the digital signal using digital signal processing
and then converted back to an analog value via a D/A converter and
fed back to the input canceling the baseline.41

Ion current recordings were analyzed
using Clampfit 10.4 and custom-written
Matlab codes. An ion current pulse was defined as a current change
equal to at least double root-mean-square of the baseline signal.
Recordings at each condition, i.e., pore diameter, KCl concentration,
and voltage, contained at least 200 events corresponding to passage
of single particles.

Particles
Carboxylated polystyrene
particles with a
diameter between 410 nm and 5 μm and 400 nm poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) particles were used in the experiments (Bangs Laboratories,
Fisher, IN). For all recordings, a KCl solution (0.1 M or 10 mM, pH
10) with ∼2 × 109 particles per mL was placed
on one side of the membrane while the other side of the membrane was
in contact with pure KCl of the same concentration as used for the
particle solution. KCl solutions with particles contained 0.1% (v/v)
Tween 80.

Metal Replica of the Channels
Porous membranes were
obtained by chemical etching of 12 μm thick PET foils after
heavy ion irradiation with 107 ions/cm2 at the
UNILAC linear accelerator at the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion
Research (Darmstadt, Germany). The chemical etching was performed
in the same conditions as the single-pore samples, i.e., in 0.5 M
NaOH at 70 °C. A thin Au layer was sputtered on one side of the
membrane and electrochemically reinforced with copper. This layer
acts as the cathode, while an Au wire acts as the anode in a two electrode
setup. Au wires were electrodeposited using a gold sulfite-based bath
at 50 °C, applying −0.7 V. The Au adopts the shape and
size of the channels, thus scanning electron microscope (SEM) investigations
on the wire morphology after PET dissolution in 9 M NaOH at room temperature
yield information on the geometry of the channels investigated.

Cell Culture
Mice cells J774A.1 (ATCC TIB-67) were
grown and maintained (5% CO2, 37 °C) in DMEM (Life
Technologies 10569-010) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life
Technologies 26140-079) and 2 mM l-glutamine (Life Technologies
25030-081). 60% J774A.1 confluent cells were trypsinized with 1% trypsin-EDTA
(Life Technologies 15400-054), then counted and resuspended in PBS
(Life Technologies 10010-023) to 1 × 104 cells/mL.

Results and Discussion
Figure 2 shows
example resistive pulses
obtained with negatively charged polystyrene particles passing through
a 3 μm diameter pore. In our electrode configuration, positive
voltages indicate electroosmotic transport; for negative voltages,
the particles translocated in the direction of electrophoresis. In
this experiment, translocations were observed for both voltage polarities,
albeit with different current profiles, indicating zeta potential
of the particles was comparable to the zeta potential of the pore
walls. Using the resistive pulse analysis relating the particle size
with the amplitude of recorded pulses,9,11 and including
the access resistance of the system,42 we
found the average size of particles passing through the pore at negative
voltages is ∼1 μm, close to the nominal diameter given
by the manufacturer, while for positive voltages the size is ∼1.5
μm. Size of the particles determined by the resistive-pulse
technique is known to be voltage-independent.9,11 Thus,
these experiments suggest larger particles are capable of being electroosmotically
transported due to their lower overall surface charge density. Both
dynamic light scattering and SEM imaging confirmed the sizes predicted
using the resistive pulse.

Figure 2 Example translocations of ∼1 μm
negatively charged
polystyrene particles through a single 3 μm in diameter pore.
The particles translocated in the direction of electrophoresis at
−1 V (a) and electroosmosis at +1 V (c). (b,d) Corresponding
scatter plots of the relative current change (Ie – Ip)/Ip vs translocation time are shown. Ie and Ip indicate ion current through
the pore without and with a particle, respectively. The recordings
were performed in 0.1 M KCl, pH 10 with the custom designed amplifier;
the commercially available amplifier Axopatch 200B cannot measure
currents higher than 200 nA.

Resistive pulses of the ∼1 μm particles recorded
for
both voltage polarities were composed of a current decrease and a
current increase. As previously discussed,30,43 the double-peak character of the pulses results from the transient
modification of ionic concentrations at the pore entrance and exit
caused by the translocating particles. The ionic enhancement occurs
when a negatively charged particle is at the pore end in contact with
a positively biased electrode. Consequently, resistive-pulses of particles
moving in the electrophoretic direction consist of a current decrease
followed by a positive peak. Particles whose transport is dominated
by electroosmosis translocate for the opposite voltage polarity, and
their resistive pulses begin with a current increase.30

Scatter plots of relative current change, (Ie – Ip)/Ip where Ie and Ip are currents without and with a particle,
respectively,
and pulse duration of the two recordings shown in Figure 1 suggest for this pore the electroosmotic translocations
are characterized by a larger variability of translocation times compared
to the electrophoretic transport. The dispersion of event durations
cannot be attributed to size variations of particles, since the distribution
of relative current change due to electroosmotic transport was similar
to electrophoresis-dominated transport (Supporting
Information, Figure S1). The observation on large variability
of the translocation times was reported before in resistive-pulse
experiments in which particles passed through a pore by externally
applied pressure difference.44,45 Radial position of
the particles with respect to the pore axis was predicted to greatly
affect the translocation time and have smaller influence on the pulse
amplitude. The large variability of translocation times in our experiments
suggests the particles can indeed follow different trajectories when
passing through the pores.

In order to facilitate comparison
of experiments performed at different
voltages, pores, and particles, all recordings were analyzed using
histograms of resistive pulse durations. For each recording at least
200 events were analyzed. The histograms allowed us to find weighted
average and variance for each parameter and calculate the percentage
variation in the determination of average translocation time. Because
of the large number of pulses analyzed in each voltage, the standard
error of the variance does not exceed 10%. Figure 3 summarizes the analysis for the recordings performed with
∼1 μm particles and 3 μm pore at different voltages
(pore 3) and compares the findings with analysis of two other, independently
prepared pores with an average opening diameter of 3.2 and 4 μm
(pores 1–2). The analysis suggests that translocation times
in all the studied pores were characterized by dispersions significantly
higher compared to our earlier experiments with particles.29,46 This effect was especially pronounced in cases when the transport
occurred in the direction of electroosmosis.

Figure 3 Analysis of translocation
times of five different pores prepared
in 12 μm thick PET films by the track-etching technique. Applied
voltage in volts is indicated on the x-axis. The
final length of the pores (L) is related with the
pore opening diameter (D) due to etching away of
the material. Pores with larger opening diameter are shorter. Particle
diameter is marked as d. Orange and blue bars represent
analysis of electroosmotic and electrophoretic transport of particles,
respectively. Examples of resistive pulses for each pore are shown
as insets. The percentage variability was calculated as the square
root of variance divided by the average; both parameters were found
based on histograms of translocation times as first two central moments.
Ion current through pores 1, 2, 4, and 5 was performed with Axopatch
200B; pore 3 was studied using the custom built amplifier.

The three pores were prepared by etching heavy
ion irradiated polymer
films with an initial thickness of 12 μm. Since the opening
diameter was a few micrometers, the etching process also led to a
significant thinning of the films and lowering of the pore aspect
ratio to ∼3. Our earlier experiments were performed with pores
prepared in the same type of films, but their diameter was always
sub-1.5 μm assuring an aspect ratio above 6.26,29,30 Figure 3 compares,
in addition, the dispersion of translocation times in the three short
pores (pores 1–3) with two long pores (pores 4,5) with an opening
diameter of ∼1 μm and length of ∼11 μm used
to observe electrophoretic transport of 410 nm carboxylated polystyrene
particles and electroosmotic translocation of 400 nm PMMA uncharged
particles. Translocation times in the longer pores were characterized
by low dispersion typically not exceeding 20%.

The analysis
in Figure 3 suggests pores
with low, less than 4, aspect ratios producing wide distributions
of translocation times. This result, at least partly, could be explained
by the existence of various paths a particle can take when approaching
and translocating a pore.47 As the next
step, we wanted to understand whether pore roughness, observed as
ion current fluctuations within resistive pulse, influence the distribution
of event durations as well. Additional resistive-pulse experiments
were therefore performed using pores with an average opening diameter
between 1.3 and 15 μm and length between 11 and 35 μm.

Figure 4 summarizes variability of translocation
times recorded for six additional pores. In general, pores with aspect
ratio above 5 produced significantly lower dispersion of translocation
times compared to short structures. For longer pores, the dispersion
reached ∼30% only when the pore was characterized with large
modulations of the pore opening diameter and contained large cavities
such that the current in the pulse approached the baseline current
(pore 6, 1.3 μm in diameter, Figure 4). The data for 2 μm particles passing through 5, 6, and 7
μm in diameter pores with length ∼30 μm indicate
the translocation time varies more significantly in wider pores. A
similar conclusion can be drawn noticing a larger dispersion in the
recordings with 280 nm particles versus 410 nm particles electrophoretically
passing through a 1.3 μm pore (pore 5 in Figure 4). The bar graph also shows analysis of 5 μm particles
translocating a low aspect ratio pore with an opening diameter of
15 μm (pore 1); the data support our earlier conclusion (Figure 3) that short pores produce a wide distribution of
event durations.

Figure 4 Dispersion of translocation times of six pores with varying
opening
diameter, length, and topography. Applied voltage in volts is indicated
on the x-axis. Examples of resistive pulses for each
pore are shown as insets. L, D,
and d stand for pore length, pore diameter, and the
particle diameter. Orange and blue bars represent analysis of electroosmotic
and electrophoretic transport of particles, respectively. Recordings
in pores 1–4 in 0.1 M KCl were performed using the custom built
amplifier. Data in 10 mM KCl in pore 4 and all recordings in pores
5–6 were obtained using Axopatch 200B.

Roughness of PET pores prepared by the track-etching technique
was confirmed by us directly via an imaging metal replica of multipore
membranes.28,29 This approach provided a convenient
way of investigating topography of many pores prepared in the same
way. Here we use the same template approach to understand whether
pore roughness increases with the increase of the etching time. Figure 5 shows representative wires electrodeposited in
originally 12 μm thick PET membranes with average diameters
of (a) 490 ± 40, (b) 660 ± 30, and (c) 1230 ± 70 nm.
The images display the overall cylindrical geometry of the wires (i.e.,
the channels) together with the irregular profile along the channel
axis, attributed to the layered structure of the pristine PET foils.28 Analysis of the shape of wires (n > 20) of each sample revealed that the number of large protuberances
defined as a diameter increase larger than 15% from the average value
and does not depend on the etching time. Longer etching times, however,
promote formation of additional smaller irregularities and longitudinal
widening of the large cavities (Figure 5).
The range of opening diameters investigated by the metal replica method
is narrower than the range of pore openings used in the resistive-pulse
experiments due to limited availability of thicker polymer films irradiated
with many ions.

Figure 5 SEM images of representative gold wires electrodeposited
in PET
membranes containing 107pores/cm2. The PET membranes
were obtained by irradiating originally 12 μm thick PET films
and etching in 0.5 M NaOH, 70 °C for (a) 136 min, (b) 180 min,
and (c) 300 min. Average wire diameters are 490 nm (a), 660 nm (b),
and 1230 nm (c).

In order to interpret
the resistive-pulse data and dispersion of
translocation times, we considered properties of electroosmostic velocity
of fluid in a pore with an undulating opening diameter. Continuity
equation imposes the fluid velocity in narrower regions must be higher
than in the wider parts of the pore. As a consequence, a wider zone
pulls the liquid from the narrower region where a lower pressure is
established. Thus, transport of particles through a charged pore with
undulating opening diameter has to be considered as an electrokinetic
flow with a superimposed pressure difference.19,20 Interestingly, local pressure drops and position dependent velocity
distribution were predicted theoretically and observed experimentally
before in an electroosmotic flow in a smooth, cylindrical capillary
with inhomogeneous zeta potential.34−36 The visualization of
the flow in this system was achieved by using an optically activated
fluorescent dye of caged 5-(and 6)-carboxy-Q-rhodamine.35

Figure 6 shows
the cross-section of a pore
system that was numerically modeled to understand the radial and axial
dependence of electroosmosis induced fluid velocities in a pore with
undulating opening diameter. A positively biased electrode was placed
at the right opening of the pore, thus in this configuration, the
electroosmotic fluid flow is directed from right to left. Velocity
profile and ion current were modeled by numerically solving coupled
Poisson–Nernst–Planck and Navier–Stokes equations.26,48 Achieving convergent solutions required a large computational power
and a pore with length of 4.2 μm was considered to make the
computation tractable while providing the requisite physical insight.
The pore contained two narrower entrances with an opening diameter
of 350 nm and a wider cavity with a tunable diameter between 450 and
750 nm. We also performed modeling of a 0.9 μm long structure
consisting of three zones with opening diameters of 350, 550, and
350 nm, respectively. The pores carried a homogeneous surface charge
density of −0.5 e/nm2. All calculations were performed
in 10 mM KCl as bulk electrolyte.

Figure 6 Radial profiles of axial velocity at five
different positions along
an axis of a 4.2 μm long pore with undulating opening diameter
and surface charge density of −0.5 e/nm2. Bulk electrolyte
concentration was set as 10 mM KCl. The modeling was performed by
numerically solving coupled Poisson–Nernst–Planck and
Navier–Stokes equations. The modeled structure is schematically
shown in the upper left panel (not to scale).

Figure 6 presents radial profiles
of fluid
velocity at five different positions along the axis of the 4.2 μm
long pore. In the narrower regions, the velocity is relatively flat
with a local minimum at the pore axis and maxima close to the pore
walls. Similar profiles were reported for a smooth cylindrical pore
with fluid flow occurring under the opposing influence of electroosmosis
and pressure difference.49,50 Velocity profiles in
the wider, middle region of the pore are however more complex and
dependent on the axial position. Both ends of the wider region are
characterized by a radial velocity profile such that the maximum velocity
occurs at the pore axis, and two local minima are present at a small
distance from the pore walls. Velocity in the radial direction in
the zone between the walls and distance a is a few
times lower than at the pore center; the difference is more pronounced
for larger undulations. For the undulation a = 200
nm, the liquid even 100 nm away from the walls is almost stalled.
The middle of the wider pore region (x3 in Figure 6) has a qualitatively similar
profile as the one observed in the narrower regions (x1 and x5).

Velocity
profiles observed at the cross sections x2 and x4 in Figure 6 are well-known in macroscopic systems and are explained
by a boundary layer at the walls, which is unable to follow sharp
turns and corners.39,51,52 In systems with high Reynolds numbers, flow separation can be observed
where the boundary layer moves in the opposite direction to the main
fluid flow through the center of the channel. In our system, the velocity
did not change the sign but significantly decreased over an extended
radial region. The modeling also confirmed formation of local pressure
differences, whose magnitudes were the largest for the largest diameter
undulations (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Modeled pressure profiles
along the pore axis of a pore with undulating
diameter whose scheme is shown in Figure 6.
The value of “a” indicates the magnitude
of the step size change of the opening diameter of the middle region
(Figure 6).

We also modeled velocity profiles in a shorter pore with
an aspect
ratio of ∼3 (Figure 8). The absolute
values of velocities are higher than in the 4.2 μm long pore
due to a larger electric field set by the same potential difference
of 1 V. Qualitatively, the velocity profile in the narrower region
is similar to what was obtained for a longer pore (Figure 6). Since the step in the pore opening diameter (a = 100 nm) is comparable to the length of each pore segment
(300 nm), fluid velocity in the wider region never reaches the flatter
profile but contains the three extrema at all positions along the
axis (x2 in Figure 8d).

The obtained velocity profiles suggest that depending on
the path
a particle takes when passing through a pore, it can move with significantly
different velocities resulting in different translocation times. The
large radial velocity gradients are especially pronounced in the wider
regions of a pore where the velocity at the pore axis can be several
times larger than closer to the walls. In pores with many undulations
created during prolonged etching, a large portion of the pore length
can feature the more complex velocity profiles, which could indeed
lead to dramatically different translocation times. Translocation
times in addition might be affected by a trajectory of the particle
close to the pore entrance, which determines the radial position in
the beginning of the translocation process.53 In a given pore, a smaller particle can probe more radial positions
with different velocities leading to wider distribution of translocation
times compared to larger particles.

Figure 8 (a) Scheme of a 900 nm long pore modeled
by the Poisson–Nernst–Planck
and Navier–Stokes equations in 10 mM KCl, with 1 V applied
across the pore with a positively biased electrode on the right-hand
side. (b) Pressure profile along the pore axis. The pore openings
are at the position 0 and 0.9 μm. (c,d) Radial velocity profiles
at two positions along the pore axis, as indicated in part a.

Since the pores exhibit pressure
and velocity profiles that are
axial position dependent, it raises the possibility that the pores
could significantly deform a soft translocating particle. Previously,
pores with undulating opening diameters were used to detect transport
of 300 nm in diameter deformable hydrogels.26 Negatively charged hydrogels passed through sub-1 μm polymer
pores in the direction of electroosmosis, and the developed inhomogeneous
pressure distribution led to the hydrogels’ collapse and possible
dehydration. In this study we decided to determine whether pressure
and velocity gradients in larger pores are sufficient to deform microscopic
objects such as biological cells.

Figure 9 shows example electroosmotic passage
of single mouse J774A.1 macrophage cells from reticulum cell sarcoma
present in a solution together with 108/mL 5 μm negatively
charged polystyrene particles. Because of the large size difference,
passage of the cells could be easily distinguished among the translocation
of the smaller particles. Resistive pulses of both the polystyrene
particles and the cells consisted of two downward peaks suggesting
the pore contained a larger cavity in the middle. The pulses of hard
polystyrene particles were symmetric suggesting the constriction zones
at the two pore entrances had similar opening diameters. The two peaks
in pulses corresponding to the cells were however characterized by
significantly different amplitudes suggesting the intrinsically built
in pressure differences in a pore with undulating opening diameter
could have deformed the cells; the second, smaller current decrease
could therefore correspond to an effectively smaller cell. Our experiments
therefore suggest that in order to elucidate mechanical properties
of passing objects it is important to know the pore topography and
to perform comparative studies with hard spheres. Interpretation of
resistive-pulses created by hydrogels was also facilitated by comparison
with pulses of polystyrene particles.26

passage from the same recording are shown. Solution on one side of
the membrane contained 0.1 M KCl with 108 particles/cm3 and ∼2 × 104 cells spiked into a 2
mL solution. Both the particles and the cells passed in the direction
of electroosmosis at 0.4 V. The recordings were performed with the
custom built amplifier.

Conclusions
We have presented resistive-pulse experiments
with polystyrene
particles passing through polymer pores by electrophoresis and electroosmosis.
Because of the undulating opening diameter of the pores, electroosmotic
velocity exhibits complex dependence on both the radial and axial
positions. As a result, pores with finite surface charges and large
longitudinal irregularities produce wide distributions of translocation
times even in cases when the particles move in the direction of electrophoresis.
The velocity variations are even more pronounced in pores with low
aspect ratios and pores where the properties of the boundary layer
close to the walls dominate velocity profile over an extended length
of the pore.

Pores with undulating opening diameter however
provide an important
analytical tool due to the presence of intrinsic pressure drops at
the boundaries between regions with a different opening diameter.
Our experiments with biological cells presented here as well as earlier
experiments with hydrogels26 suggest the
developed pressure gradients of a few hundreds of Pa are sufficient
to deform the passing objects and might inform about their mechanical
properties. Pores with undulating opening diameter have the potential
of extending the resistive-pulse technique beyond sizing and provide
a high-throughput technique of probing mechanical properties of meso
and micro-objects.

In order to mitigate the issue of large dispersion
of translocation
times, we performed analysis of the dependence of the velocity profiles
on the length of pore undulations. We have found that when the wider
regions are sufficiently long, the velocity profiles in all regions
reach similar characteristics and exhibit small radial variability;
such pores are expected to produce narrow distribution of translocation
times and a good estimate of the object electrokinetic velocity. Our
experiments and analysis point therefore to the importance of the
pore topography and geometry for the outcome of resistive-pulse experiments.
In our future studies we plan to prepare metal replica of single-pore
samples used for resistive-pulse experiments to be able to correlate
the resistive-pulse shape and modeled velocity profiles with exactly
known pore geometry.
