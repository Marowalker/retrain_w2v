We report the design and performance
of a polymer microfluidic
device that can affinity select multiple types of biological cells
simultaneously with sufficient recovery and purity to allow for the
expression profiling of mRNA isolated from these cells. The microfluidic
device consisted of four independent selection beds with curvilinear
channels that were 25 μm wide and 80 μm deep and were
modified with antibodies targeting antigens specifically expressed
by two different cell types. Bifurcated and Z-configured device geometries
were evaluated for cell selection. As an example of the performance
of these devices, CD4+ T-cells and neutrophils were selected from
whole blood as these cells are known to express genes found in stroke-related
expression profiles that can be used for the diagnosis of this disease.
CD4+ T-cells and neutrophils were simultaneously isolated with purities
>90% using affinity-based capture in cyclic olefin copolymer (COC)
devices with a processing time of ∼3 min. In addition, sufficient
quantities of the cells could be recovered from a 50 μL whole
blood input to allow for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) following cell lysis. The expression of genes from isolated
T-cells and neutrophils, such as S100A9, TCRB, and FPR1, was evaluated using RT-PCR.
The modification and isolation procedures demonstrated here can also
be used to analyze other cell types as well where multiple subsets
must be interrogated.

==== Body
Isolation
of pure leukocyte
subsets and their molecular analysis from whole blood is challenged
by the presence of numerous interfering cells.1 The use of conventional isolation methods such as density gradient
centrifugation, sedimentation, and fluorescence assisted cell sorting
(FACS) is typically time-consuming, requires large volumes of blood,
and employs sophisticated equipment. Microfluidics, however, are extremely
attractive for blood analysis because of the potentially short assay
turnaround times and the ability to design devices for point-of-care
applications.2,3

The use of microfluidics
to isolate certain types of leukocytes
has attracted wide interest. For example, Cheng et al. reported a
two-stage microfluidic for the isolation of CD4+ T-cells; a purity
of ∼90% was achieved.4−6 Lee and co-workers constructed
a functionalized silicon and quartz nanowire array to separate CD4+
T-cells from mouse splenocytes.7,8 Thorslund et al. fabricated
a glass/PDMS/anti-CD4 microfluidic chip containing different architectural
features for CD4+ T-cell isolation.9 Warner
et al. reported a microfluidic neutrophil-capture device followed
by gene expression analysis to observe changes after trauma injury.10 They obtained purities of 95% by processing
150 μL of whole blood through the chip that isolated ∼25,000
cells and yielded 69 ng of RNA. Common to these elegant examples was
that only a single cell type was isolated from the sample.

Stroke
is the third leading cause of disability and death in the
United States.11 There are two types of
stroke: (i) ischemic stroke, caused by vessel occlusion, occurs at
a frequency of 80–85% and (ii) hemorrhagic stroke, resulting
from vessel rupture, is identified in 15–20% of all stroke-related
cases. Unfortunately, these two conditions cannot be differentiated
using existing clinical tests, which typically employ computed tomography
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Additionally, a third of
all patients presenting stroke-like symptoms actually suffer from
nonvascular disease.12 It is imperative
that stroke diagnosis be made quickly and accurately because treatments
for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke differ and there is a short time
window (∼4.5 h) for effective treatment.13−17

Because head-related trauma or stroke tissue
is not easily acquired
and researchers have looked for markers in the peripheral blood due
to its accessibility,18−20 there have been ongoing efforts to find reliable
blood-based stroke biomarkers that afford high clinical sensitivity
and specificity.21 Several potential biomarker
candidates that can be measured in serum or plasma have been identified
with their role in the underlying pathophysiology.22

Reports have shown that T-lymphocyte mediated anti-inflammatory
responses in ischemic brain injury23−26 and the expression of nearly
5,700 genes related to T-cell function change in cases of head trauma.27 mRNA can be harvested from specific types of
blood cells and used as biomarkers that reflect the systemic changes
in stroke.28 Transcripts of promise for
detecting and differentiating between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke
include S100A9 and IL1R2.29−32 Gene expression studies conducted by Adamski et al. identified differential
expression across different leukocyte subsets, such as CD4+ T-cells
and neutrophils.33 These cells are known
to express genes found in stroke-related expression profiles.34 Therefore, the ability to rapidly isolate these
leukocyte subsets and secure their mRNA expression profile without
interference from other leukocyte subsets could provide a viable test
for diagnosing various types of stroke.35−38 Isolation of pure fractions of
these subsets is critical to provide unbiased expression data.

In this manuscript, we report a microfluidic device that can simultaneously
isolate different types of cells using affinity agents. As an example,
we show the positive selection of CD4+ T-cells and CD66b+ neutrophils
from minute amounts of unprocessed blood. Total RNA (TRNA) was extracted
from the isolated cells and reverse transcribed to monitor mRNA expression
changes from the isolated cells. The selected subsets were used to
expression profile certain genes that possess diagnostic value for
stroke. The figures-of-merit for two device geometries were evaluated
as well as the applicability of two different polymers, poly(methyl
methacrylate), PMMA, and cyclic olefin copolymer, COC, for optimizing
antibody load and cell recovery. We also introduce a chemical-based
polymer surface activation method that utilized sodium hydroxide and
isopropanol, which provided efficient and simple polymer surface activation
resulting in high antibody loads to improve recovery.

Microfluidic Device Fabrication
and Assembly
Information
on device fabrication can be found in the Supporting
Information. The architectures for the 2 devices evaluated
herein differed in terms of addressing the selection beds (4 per device),
employing either a bifurcation network or Z-configuration (Figures 1A,B,D,E and S1, Supporting
Information). In the Z-configuration device (Figure S1B, Supporting Information), each cell isolation unit consisted
of 64 curvilinear channels that were 9,000 × 25 × 80 μm
(l × w × h) with a center-to-center spacing of 200 μm. Two 150 μm
wide inlet and outlet channels poised orthogonally to the isolation
channels addressed the selection bed. The surface area of a single
bed including inlet and outlet channel was 132.3 mm2 (1.9
mm2, 1.15 μL per channel).

the four isolation beds filled with red dye
in Z and bifurcated designs. (B, E) SEMs of the isolation beds for
both the bifurcated and Z devices. (C, F) Computational simulations
showing the shear stresses in the inlet of the Z-configuration device
and in the parallel channels of the bifurcated device. (G) T-cells
isolated from blood from the left in the 3, 2, 1, and 0 bifurcation
levels of the bifurcated device. All curvilinear channel dimensions
are 25 × 80 μm (w × h), and the SEM scale bars are 1 mm for all micrographs.

The bifurcated device contained isolation beds
with 16 curvilinear
channels that were 11,000 × 25 × 80 μm (l × w × h) with a center-to-center
spacing of 330 μm between channels (Figure S1A, Supporting Information). Each isolation bed’s
surface area was 36.8 mm2 (2.3 mm2/channel)
with a volume of 352 nL. Addressing each bed required four bifurcations
with an additional two bifurcations for the four independent isolation
units. All four isolation beds shared a common inlet port with different
outlet ports for each cell isolation unit (Figure 1D,E). The total surface area, including the bifurcation network,
was 43.4 mm2.

Chemical Surface Modification
Assembled
devices were
filled with a mixture of 5:1 (v/v) 2 M NaOH/100% IPA using input/output
tubing sealed to the chip. Once filled, the chips were incubated with
the activating solution in a hybridization oven (Boekel Scientific)
for 12 h at 65 °C for COC and 30 min at room temperature for
PMMA unless otherwise noted. Chips were rinsed with 1 mL of nanopure
water.

Antibody (Ab) Immobilization to Activated Polymer Surfaces
Ab immobilization was a two-step process. In the first step, 50
mg/mL EDC and 5 mg/mL NHS in 100 mM MES (pH = 4.8) was introduced
into the device and incubated for 15 min at room temperature followed
by flushing with PBS. Then, a 15 μL aliquot of 0.5 mg/mL mouse
antihuman CD4 or antihuman CD66b monoclonal antibody (mAb) was introduced
into the device and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The selection
bed was then rinsed with 1 mL of PBS (pH = 7.4).

Cell Isolation
from Whole Blood and Staining
Whole
blood samples were obtained from anonymous healthy donors at the UNC
Blood Bank in accordance with UNC Institutional Review Board (IRB)
procedures. Peripheral blood samples were collected by venipuncture
in Vacutainer tubes containing EDTA (7.5% in 0.06 mL; Tyco Health Care). Samples were processed within 4 h following collection.
Processing steps for the blood samples using the microfluidic device
are described in the Supporting Information.

Flow Cytometric (FC) Analysis of Selected MOLT-3 Cells
MOLT-3
cells (human acute lymphoblastic leukemia) were cultured as
a suspension in 25 cm2 culture flasks (Cell Treat Scientific,
Shirley, MA) containing RPMI 1640 Medium (Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY) supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY). FC was performed using a Beckman-Coulter CyAn instrument equipped
with a 25 mW, 488 nm Coherent sapphire (blue) laser. Detailed protocols
for the FC analysis are presented in the Supporting
Information.

Evaluation of Carboxylic Acid Surface Densities
Cy3-modified
oligonucleotides containing a 5′ pendant amino group served
as fluorescent reporters by covalently labeling surface confined carboxylic
acids. Carboxylic acid surface densities were also quantified by a
colorimetric assay using TBO. Changes in surface hydrophobicity were
measured via water contact angle measurements. Experimental details
for these assays are described in the Supporting
Information.

Fluorescence Microscopy
Cell characterization
was performed
by acquiring images on an Olympus IX71-DSU Spinning Disk Confocal
inverted microscope with DAPI, FITC, and Texas Red filter sets, a
mercury burner arc lamp, and high sensitivity Hamamatsu EMCCD and
high resolution Hamamatsu ORCA-03G CCD cameras. Metamorph software
was used for analyzing and processing images. Exposure times for DAPI,
FITC, and Texas Red were 10, 300, and 500 ms, respectively.

Reverse
Transcription (RT) and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
CD4+
T-cells and neutrophils isolated on-chip were lysed by infusing
∼20 μL of lysis solution (GenElute Mammalian Total RNA
Miniprep Kit, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) through the cell selection bed.
The effluent was collected into a microfuge tube and purified using
a total RNA miniprep kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol with DNase treatment (On-Column DNase I, Sigma, St. Louis,
MO). After purification of TRNA, reverse transcription (RT) was accomplished
using a ProtoScript II First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England
BioLabs, Ipswich, MA). Samples were prepared by mixing 10 μL
of reaction mix, 2 μL of poly-T primer, 2 μL of enzyme
(no enzyme, 2 μL of water for RT), and 6 μL of TRNA. The
samples were then incubated at 42 °C for 1 h and heated to 80
°C for 5 min to deactivate the RT enzyme. See Supporting Information for experimental details on PCR.

Statistical Analysis and Computational Methods
Data
were analyzed using a student’s two-tailed t test (ANOVA). Statistical significance was assigned where p < 0.0500. Shear stress and flow uniformity through
the bifurcated device was evaluated using COMSOL Multiphysics 4.3b.39 Flow distribution analysis in the Z-configuration
device employed a custom numerical algorithm detailed elsewhere.40

Results and Discussion
Polymer Surface Activation
for Ab Attachment
Stable
attachment of mAbs to the surfaces of the selection bed, which were
made from a polymer, is critical for efficient recovery and purity
of the target cells. mAb surface density and uniformity throughout
the selection channel is dependent on the activation protocol employed
in cases where the mAb concentration exceeds the surface functional
group number (see Figure S2, Supporting Information). We have reported that activating microchannel surfaces via UV/ozone
irradiation causes two effects: (i) optical absorption by the bulk
polymer with transmission decreasing with higher dose levels, which
can cause functional group surface densities to become increasingly
nonuniform as the aspect ratio of the channel is increased and (ii)
fragmentation of the polymer during irradiation reducing functional
group surface density, especially during thermal fusion bonding. UV
and thermally treated COC devices were less susceptible to these artifacts
compared to PMMA.39

We sought to
avoid these effects by filling assembled devices with an activating
chemical solution. Therefore, we investigated the use of a chemical
modification protocol following thermal assembly of the device. Microchannels
were chemically activated via incubation in 5:1 (v/v) 2 M NaOH/IPA
solution. In the case of PMMA, NaOH is known to hydrolyze PMMA’s
ester groups and we hypothesized that IPA encouraged interaction with
the hydrophobic polymer (water contact angle of PMMA = 76.4 ±
1.4°, see Supporting Information) and/or solvation of methoxide byproducts.41,42 Incubation of PMMA with higher IPA/NaOH concentrations caused irreversible
channel deformation due to solvent swelling (Figure S3C,D, Supporting Information).

Chemical activation
of PMMA did not change the water contact angle
or carboxylic acid surface density as determined by a TBO assay (see Supporting Information) relative to the pristine
surface; this was likely due to poor sensitivity of the TBO assay
in comparison to fluorescence assays using Cy3-labeled oligonucleotides
containing a pendant amino group that served as a fluorescent reporter
of surface-confined carboxylic acids. Chemically activated PMMA microchannels
derivatized with Cy3-labeled oligonucleotides showed 232 ± 47
cps compared to 503 ± 72 cps for UV-activated and thermally treated
PMMA microchannels (Figure S3A,E, Supporting
Information).

COC microchannels were subjected to a similar
treatment (5:1 (v/v)
2 M NaOH/IPA, see Supporting Information). Chemical activation decreased COC’s water contact angle
from 95.5 ± 1.8° (pristine) to 63.3 ± 3.2° and
increased the carboxyl surface density to 0.6 ± 0.2 nmol/cm2 as determined by the TBO assay, which approached a theoretical
monolayer (0.83 nmol/cm2). Carboxyl formation was also
evident by fluorescence analysis using Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide
probes, where the surface fluorescence intensity (4369 ± 437
cps) for chemical modification was significantly greater than that
observed for the UV activated and thermally treated COC microchannels
(2357 ± 218 cps, see Figure S3B, Supporting
Information). The mechanism for carboxyl formation for COC
using these chemical conditions is currently unknown; literature precedence
necessitates a radical-forming catalyst, such as Cu, Fe, or other
heavy metals to convert alkanes, such as those found in COC, directly
to carboxylic acid groups.43 We suspect
that additives incorporated into the COC polymer during manufacturing
assist in forming the surface carboxylic acids. On the basis of covalent
labeling of surface-confined carboxylic acids, chemical treatment
of COC resulted in the highest production of these surface functional
groups.

Microfluidic Architectures and Performance Evaluation
Two microfluidic devices were fabricated both of which contained
four separate isolation beds to facilitate the simultaneous positive
selection of multiple types of cells. We chose to target T-cells using
anti-CD4 and neutrophils using anti-CD66b mAbs. In all cases, the
concentration of mAb used to optimize recovery was 0.5 mg/mL (see
Figure S2, Supporting Information). To
facilitate simultaneous isolation of T-cells within two beds and neutrophils
in the remaining two beds from a blood sample (Figure 1A,D), the beds were modified by introducing the EDC/NHS solution
through the common inlet followed by mAb infusion through the individual
isolation bed outlets so that beds could be functionalized with different
mAbs. This design also enabled the lysis of each subset contained
within a bed for downstream analysis, such as mRNA expression, by
infusing a lysis solution through the common inlet and lysate collection
from the four separate outlets.

The two microfluidic devices
differed in how the parallel channels were addressed. In the first
device (Figure 1D), a bifurcation network was
utilized to address 16 channels, thereby requiring four bifurcations
per isolation unit. The second device (Figure 1A) employed a Z-configuration, where inlet and outlet channels were
poised orthogonal to the cell selection channels (64 per device).39,40 Due to the larger number of channels within the Z-configuration,
this device had a higher throughput; 50 μL of blood could be
processed in 3 min maintaining a 2 mm/s linear velocity to optimize
recovery44 compared to 13 min for the bifurcated
design. Using a previously reported and experimentally validated numerical
algorithm,40 we calculated the flow distribution
through the Z-configuration and found that the linear velocity ranged
between 1.7 and 2.5 mm/s for each isolation bed in the parallel arrangement
(Figure S4B, Supporting Information).
For the bifurcated device (Figures S4A and S5, Supporting Information), the fluid velocity within each isolation
bed was uniform. The variability in the flow velocity seen within
each isolation bed of the Z-configuration can result in variable cell
recoveries.

To evaluate the performance of the two microfluidic
designs and
surface activation chemistry, T-cells and neutrophils were isolated
from blood and their recoveries determined. All cell counts and purities
are summarized in Table S1, Supporting Information, and a box plot is shown in Figure 2A. In
this discussion, we differentiate the UV and chemical activation modalities
by UV- and CH-, respectively. For COC chips and the bifurcated or
Z-configuration, these were designated as UV-COCbif and
UV-COCZ, respectively, when UV activated and CH-COCbif and CH-COCZ when chemically activated.

Initial testing of the
bifurcated design indicated that, with either
activation protocol, COC outperformed PMMA devices. UV-COCbif isolated 798 ± 167 CD4+ T-cells cells compared to 325 ±
85 cells for UV-PMMAbif from a 50 μL blood sample
input (Table S1, Supporting Information). These agree with our previous results, which indicated efficient
and uniform activation in COC microchannels providing a higher mAb
load and, thus, higher recoveries for circulating tumor cells.39 CH-PMMAbif devices demonstrated poor
performance (7 ± 3 cells), which reflected the inability to chemically
activate PMMA without degrading microstructures (see Figure S3, Supporting Information). Results for CH-COCbif devices (702 ± 386 cells) showed no statistical difference
(p = 0.631) to UV-COCbif devices (798
± 167) (Figure 2A). Chemical was as efficient
as UV activation for the bifurcated COC devices. Both UV-COC devices
produced nearly equally recovered T-cells for the common input volume
employed (50 μL): 798 ± 167 and 596 ± 154 using UV-COCbif and UV-COCZ devices, respectively. Considering
nearly the same cell recovery and higher throughput, Z-configuration
devices were used for the remainder of these studies. While the bifurcation
design could be configured with a larger number of channels to increase
throughput, it comes at the expense of device footprint; the 64-channel
Z-configuration occupied an area of 35 × 45
mm2 (4 selection beds) while the same number of channels
for 4 selection beds using the bifurcation configuration would have
required an area of 128 × 160 mm2.

We observed higher cell recovery using CH-COCZ devices;
absolute cell counts increased from 596 ± 25 for UV-COCZ to 2565 ± 1194 for the CH-COCZ devices for T-cell
isolation. In the case of neutrophils, 1096 ± 537 cells were
selected for the UV-COCZ device compared to 2949 ±
901 for the CH-COCZ device. However, we did not observe
differences between the activation modalities for bifurcated COC devices,
which can be explained by shear stress considerations.45 In bifurcated devices, ∼40% of cells
was isolated in the bifurcation regions (Figure 1G), whereas only 4% was observed in the inlet and outlet addressing
channels of the Z-configuration. Inspection of the bifurcation network
showed that fluidic shear stress was reduced from 11 dyn/cm2 in the parallel channels to 6–7 dyn/cm2 through
the bifurcation network, where ∼17.7% of the device’s
surface area accounted for ∼40% of cell isolation. Conversely,
shear stress through the Z-configuration inlet and outlet channels
ranged between 1 and 38 dyn/cm2 along the channel’s
length and was <11 dyn/cm2 through the selection channels.

For the Z-configuration, recovery occurred predominantly in the
cell isolation channels, where optical absorption of the activating
UV radiation may lead to reduced mAb loads; activating polymer surfaces
using chemical modification is not sensitive to device aspect ratio.
These effects may be precluded in bifurcated devices due to cell isolation
in the low aspect ratio bifurcation regions (Figure 1F).

Recovery of Different Leukocyte Subsets
We observed
higher recoveries for CD4 T-cells (10.3 ± 0.5%) compared to CD66b
neutrophils (1.5 ± 0.1%) in the CH-COCZ devices, assuming
relative abundances of 25,000 and 200,000 cells/50 μL of blood
for T-cells and neutrophils, respectively.46 This difference in recovery may be related to the number of mAb
molecules immobilized to the surface. With the size of anti-CD4 and
anti-CD66b being 150 kDa IgG1 and 900 kDa IgM, respectively,
they will form monolayers where IgM is ∼36× less abundant
than a monolayer of IgG, possibly leading to lower neutrophil recovery.39,47

Flow cytometric analysis was performed on T-cells and neutrophils
isolated from a buffy coat (as described in the Supporting Information). For T-cells, CD4-FITC fluorescence
intensity was 5.3× greater than the IgG isotype control, and
for neutrophils, CD66b-FITC showed 4.6× greater intensity compared
to its IgM control. However, due to the surface area of neutrophils
(∼707 μm2) compared to smaller T-cells (113
μm2), antigen density (C∞) of CD4 on T-cells is roughly 7× denser than CD66b on neutrophils.
Consequently, the rate of adhesion (kad) of T-cells to surface mAbs is ∼7× greater than for
neutrophils as stipulated by Chang and Hammer47 1  where (kf) is
the effective antibody–antigen binding rate and (Nr) is the antibody number. Thus, the ∼10-fold lower
recovery observed for neutrophils could be attributed to lower surface
density of the IgM anti-CD66b selection antibody and/or reduced surface
density of CD66b antigens on the neutrophils. We also evaluated recovery
of the MOLT-3 cell line, which demonstrated a similar T-cell size
but lower expression of CD4 (Figure S6, Supporting
Information). The recovery of MOLT-3 cells was 0.5 ± 0.1%
in the CH-COCZ (see detailed discussion in Supporting Information).

We inspected
the distribution of isolated cells throughout the
parallel channels of the Z-configuration device to relate cell counts
to linear velocity (Figure 2B). To discern
the effects of varying linear velocity on recovery, we normalized
the recovered cell counts to the total cell counts and plotted these
results as a function of linear velocity (Figure 2C). A negative correlation between linear velocity and cell
recovery was observed for both T-cells (Pearson’s correlation, r = −0.65; R2 = 0.42)
and neutrophils (r = −0.72; R2 = 0.52). The magnitude of the slope suggested that neutrophils
(m = −10.03 cells/mm/s) are more sensitive
to linear velocity and fluidic shear stress than T-cells (m = −5.17 cells/mm/s) due to the effects of lower
CD66b antigen surface density.

Purity of Isolated Leukocytes
When designing systems
for mRNA expression analysis of cell subsets isolated from blood,
it is critical to isolate pure fractions of the targets. For T-cell
isolation via CD4 positive selection, this is challenged by the fact
that CD4 is also expressed on the surface of monocytes, macrophages,
and dendritic cells at a frequency of 3–8% of the total leukocyte
population, but CD4 expression is lower compared to T-cells (46,000–202,000
molecules/cell); thus, their kad is lower
as noted by eq 1.4,48−50 This means that fluidic shear stress can be used to potentially
remove these low CD4 expressing cells due to low kad values.

Purity of isolated CD4+ T-lymphocytes
was assessed by immunostaining with CD66b, CD14, and CD20 Abs to identify
neutrophils (comprising 40–66% of total leukocyte population),
monocytes (4–8%), and B-cells (8–12%), respectively.3 Purity was defined as the ratio of DAPI+, CD14-,
CD66b-, and CD20-cells to the total number of nucleated cells. Fluorescence
images (Figure 3A–C) showed the absence
of cells labeled with CD14/66b/20 antibodies. Isolated cells showed
intact structures without an obvious change in morphology. It was
also observed that T-cells and neutrophils were distributed randomly
within the channel (outer and inner curvatures of the curvilinear
channels, Figure 1G) unlike circulating tumor
cells, which we have reported to be predominantly isolated along the
inner curvature.44 To confirm proper identification
of T-cells, an anti-CD3 marker was chosen because 87% of T-cells are
CD3+ and CD4+ (Figure 3D–F).51 For the UV-COCbif devices, purities
were 97 ± 1%, and CH-COCbif purities were 92 ±
5%, while the purity for the CH-COCZ for the CD4+ T-cells
was found to be 98 ± 1% (Table S1, Supporting
Information, and Figure 2A). The lack
of contaminating cells most likely resulted from their low CD4 expression
and the application of a shear stress between 6 and 11 dyn/cm2.48,50,52,53

morphology, (K) showed lack of CD66b-FITC signal, and (L) no Ab used.
Neutrophils were identified only if positive for both DAPI and CD66b.

Lastly, we assessed neutrophil
purity by counting double positive
DAPI and CD66b-FITC cells (Figure 3G–I).
We observed that some cells were DAPI+ and faint for CD66b-FITC, but
the dimensions and morphology of these cells were consistent with
neutrophils (Figure 3J–L).54 Neutrophil counts isolated from 50 μL
of blood using the UV-COCbif devices averaged 918 ±
91 with a purity of 94 ± 3% and CH-COCZ yielded purities
of 97 ± 2% (see Table S1, Supporting Information, for the raw data and Figure 2A for a box
plot).

Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
The total number of isolated cells in the CH-COCZ devices
ranged from 500 to 3,500 CD4+ T-cells and CD66b+ neutrophils. Considering
an average of 10 pg of TRNA per leukocyte, we expected to obtain 5–35
ng TRNA (0.25 – 1.7 ng of mRNA) per bed, which should provide
sufficient material for cDNA synthesis and gene expression analysis.
To make sure that sufficient mRNA was harvested from the T-cells and
neutrophils for the expression analysis, two beds were used for each
cell type. T-cells and neutrophils were isolated from the same blood
sample using the CH-COCZ chip, and because of the high
purity of isolated fractions, cell lysis was performed directly within
each cell isolation bed. Following lysis and TRNA extraction, an RT
reaction was performed. cDNA was then used for PCR with expression
analysis of 4 genes; S100A9, which has been shown
to be overexpressed following stroke38 and
plays a prominent role in the regulation of inflammatory processes
and immune response;55−57TCRB and FPR1 genes,
which are expressed at various levels in T-cells and neutrophils;58−60 and GAPDH, a housekeeping gene used as a reference.
Figure 4A shows a fluorescence image of the
amplicons following gel electrophoresis. Although the expression of GAPDH can vary between different types of cells,61 for these initial results, we normalized the
amplicon intensities to the intensity of the GAPDH product.

Figure 4 (A) Gel electrophoresis image of amplicons generated from mRNA
isolated from neutrophils. Negative control (−) and positive
(+) amplification reactions for tested genes were performed with products
from negative (−) RT (without RT enzyme) and positive (+) RT.
Amplicon lengths are shown in the gel image. Separation was performed
at 4.8 V/cm in a TBE buffer. (B) Normalized to GAPDH gene signals (n = 3) from the amplicons identified
on an agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide for T-cells and neutrophils.

As shown in Figure 4B for the T-cell population,
we observed significantly lower expression of S100A9 compared to the neutrophil subset for this blood donor. T-cells
showed a higher expression of the TCRB gene compared
to neutrophils; however, some studies have demonstrated neutrophils
that express TCRB mRNA.62FPR1 gene was expressed to a higher level in neutrophils
compared to T-cells, similar to that reported in the literature.63 In the case of mRNA expression profiling, if
the purity of cell populations were not high, then the expression
differences we noted in Figure 4B would not
be evident. For example, the differences in S100A9 expression between neutrophils and T-cells would not have been observed
if either fraction was contaminated with other leukocyte types.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated an affinity-based microfluidic
system capable
of isolating highly pure subsets of leukocytes from whole blood. Processing
50 μL of whole blood within ∼3 min provided sufficient
genetic material for gene expression profiling. Special emphasis was
placed on the fluid dynamics and design architecture of the device
for T-cell and neutrophil isolation to obtain high purity leukocytes
fractions using a single step. The isolation of two types of cells
from whole blood was accomplished with purity >90%.

We assessed
the effects of polymer substrate and surface activation
modalities on cell recovery and discovered a chemical activation method
for COC, which can be useful for ultrahigh aspect ratio microfluidic
devices. High aspect ratio microchannels can be used to improve throughput
reducing processing time, which may be important for securing time-sensitive
diagnosis. For example, an FDA-approved therapeutic treatment (tissue
plasminogen activator) must be administered within 3−4 h following
onset of a stroke event.

The demonstrated results are not limited
only to CD4+ T-cells and
CD66b+ neutrophils but can be expanded to analyze other cell types
simply by choosing different affinity agents for the cells of interest.
Furthermore, our microfluidic device contains four individually addressable
beds, permitting simultaneous isolation of four individual cell subpopulations
from the same blood sample with sufficient material to perform mRNA
expression analysis on the isolated cells and can be scaled to handle
more subsets.
