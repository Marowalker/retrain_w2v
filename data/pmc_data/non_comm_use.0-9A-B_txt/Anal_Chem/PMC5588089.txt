Emerging peptide
array technologies are able to profile molecular
activities within cell lysates. However, the structural diversity
of peptides leads to inherent differences in peptide signal-to-noise
ratios (S/N). These complex effects
can lead to potentially unrepresentative signal intensities and can
bias subsequent analyses. Within mass spectrometry-based peptide technologies,
the relation between a peptide’s amino acid sequence and S/N remains largely nonquantitative. To
address this challenge, we present a method to quantify and analyze
mass spectrometry S/N of two peptide
arrays, and we use this analysis to portray quality of data and to
design future arrays for SAMDI mass spectrometry. Our study demonstrates
that S/N varies significantly across
peptides within peptide arrays, and variation in S/N is attributable to differences of single amino
acids. We apply supervised machine learning to predict peptide S/N based on amino acid sequence, and identify
specific physical properties of the amino acids that govern variation
of this metric. We find low peptide–S/N concordance between arrays, demonstrating that different
arrays require individual characterization and that global peptide–S/N relationships are difficult to identify.
However, with proper peptide sampling, this study illustrates how
machine learning can accurately predict the S/N of a peptide in an array, allowing for the efficient design
of arrays through selection of high S/N peptides.

==== Body
Peptide arrays
have emerged
as an enabling tool for identifying biologically relevant peptide
substrates and molecular recognition sites, and hold great promise
as a new analytical method for basic and translational research in
the biomedical sciences.1,2 Uses of peptide arrays
include measuring changes in enzymatic activity—specifically
enzymes that add or remove post-translational modifications—to
gain insight into different cellular pathways and processes.3−5 Other applications include diagnostic or detection-focused arrays
such as differential peptide arrays to detect specific analytes in
complex mixtures6,7 or diagnose diseases.8,9 Many existing methods are based on either radioisotopic or fluorescent
labels to detect reaction products.10,11 These methods
introduce additional protocol steps, and for the latter, can alter
natural biological activity leading to false interpretations, as when
resveratrol was erroneously found to enhance deacetylation on a peptide
with an attached fluorophore.12

We
recently introduced the SAMDI mass spectrometry method, which
uses MALDI mass spectrometry to analyze peptides that are immobilized
to a self-assembled monolayer of alkanethiolates on gold (Figure 1), and we have demonstrated
the use of this method for profiling enzyme specificities,13 for discovering new enzymes,14 and for profiling activities in a lysate.15 This method provides many benefits, including the use of
surface chemistries that are intrinsically inert to the nonspecific
adsorption of protein, the availability of a broad range of chemistries
for immobilization of peptides, and, most significantly, the compatibility
with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry
to analyze the masses of the peptide-alkanethiolate conjugates. This
ability to directly measure peptide masses16 allows a straightforward analysis of peptide modifications by identifying
the corresponding mass shifts. This method has also been demonstrated
to provide a semiquantitative measure of the peptides’ substrate
activity.15 However, the S/N of a mass peak for a peptide often depends on
its amino acid sequence, resulting in both well-suited and poorly
suited peptides for inclusion in an array.

Figure 1 Measuring S/N on peptide arrays
using SAMDI MS. SAMDI MS uses MALDI mass spectrometry to analyze peptides
that are immobilized to a self-assembled monolayer of alkanethiolates
on gold. Depending on the enzyme of study, the peptides may contain
a chemical adduct, such as an acetyl group if deacetylases are the
enzymes of interest. The expected peak before enzyme treatment includes
the peptide immobilized to the alkanethiolate with the attached chemical
adduct of interest. We quantify the expected mass peak and noise using
their area under the curve to calculate peptide S/N.

In practice, the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of a peptide in mass spectrometry can vary,
making certain
sequences poorly compatible with the detection method.17,18 Hence, some fraction of peptides serves no useful purpose in an
experiment. To identify peptide array designs that maximize S/N, we synthesized two peptide arrays
and measured the S/N of each peptide
using SAMDI mass spectrometry. Then we randomly chose subsets of the
peptides from each array to train a machine learning model to be able
to predict the S/N of the remaining
peptides in their corresponding array based on amino acid sequences.
We identified and compared amino acids associated with high S/N peptides
in two peptide arrays and used machine learning to highlight properties
that predict the relationship between amino acids and S/N. While SAMDI-specific results are not generalizable,
the method we describe can be adapted and applied to diverse peptide
array technologies.

Previous work has explored peptide-S/N relationships involving peptide charge
(as with arginine residues)19,20 or hydrophilicity,
where hydrophilic proteins can be preferentially
detected in MALDI-MS due to easier cocrystallization with MALDI matrix.21,22 In addition to hydrophilicity, many specific and complex peptide-matrix
interactions can explain MALDI peptide S/N.20,23,24 Single amino acids have been reported to improve signal strength.
For example, Krause and co-workers reported that peptides containing
arginine or phenylalanine typically contributed to higher MALDI signal
strength.25 Additionally, the relationship
between S/N and amino acid sequence
gains complexity with the addition of chemical adducts. For example,
Kolarich and co-workers reported peptides with attached N-glycans
have altered signal strengths depending on MS instrument types or
subtle changes to peptides from glycosylation.26 Many studies use peptides that may have undergone oxidation25,27−29 which likely also affects peptide signal strength.
These peptide modifications introduce difficulties in signal detection
and emphasize the need to integrate computational strategies to better
understand the relationship between the amino acid sequence of a peptide
and the quality of its signal. We select peptide libraries that are
unbiased in their composition to evaluate differences in S/N due to
differing amino acid sequences, and we offer a complete empirical
analysis relating amino acid composition and S/N of the peptides.

Using statistical and machine learning strategies, we investigated
how amino acid composition affects S/N in SAMDI mass spectrometry and how subtle amino acid differences
can give rise to different S/N.
To investigate the consistency of peptide S/N relationships across
distinct experimental arrays, we focus on two synthesized peptide
arrays, each containing two consecutive variable positions (represented
by all 19 amino acids except for cysteine). The amino acids surrounding
the variable positions however are different. The two peptide arrays
are Ac-GRKacXZC (K-array) and Ac-GXZHGC (H-array). We collected
peptide spectra by SAMDI mass spectrometry and calculated the S/N of each peptide. Statistical analysis
identified amino acids associated with low or high S/N peptides. We trained machine learning models
using a random subset of peptides from each array to identify factors
that predict S/N from the physical
properties of the peptide’s amino acids. We then predicted
the S/N of the remaining peptides
and compared the predictions to our experimentally collected S/N values from SAMDI mass spectrometry.
Accurate prediction of peptide S/N from machine learning models reveals high and low quality peptides
which allows for educated and improved design of peptide arrays without
costly screening.

Materials and Methods
Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis
Data was collected from
K- and H-peptide array experiments. The K-peptide array synthesis
and methods have been previously published15 and contains peptides of the form Ac-GRKacXZC, where
X and Z represent all combinations of 19 amino acids (cysteine omitted)
for a total of 361 peptides. We synthesized another 361 membered unmodified
histidine peptide array with the sequence Ac-GXZHGC, referred to as
the H-array. The constant amino acids (everything except X or Z) are
referred to as the outside amino acids. Peptides were synthesized
using standard solid phase peptide synthesis on Fmoc-Rink Amide MBHA
resin purchased from Anaspec. Fmoc-protected amino acids were purchased
from either Anaspec or Sigma-Aldrich. The Fmoc-Rink Amide resin was
swelled in dimethylformamide (DMF) for 30 min and treated with 20%
piperidine in DMF for 20 min to remove the Fmoc protecting group.
The first Fmoc-protected amino acid was coupled to the resin with
pybop and N-methylmorpholine at a 4:4:8 ratio, which
was repeated until all the amino acids were coupled to the resin.
Once the Fmoc protecting group was removed from the final amino acid,
the resin was treated with 10% acetic anhydride in DMF for 30 min
to acetylate the N-terminus. The peptide was cleaved from the resin
with a solution of 95% trifloroacetic acid (TFA), 2.5% triethylsilane,
and 2.5% milli-q water for 2 h. To remove the resin, the solution
was filtered and precipitated with peptides with ethyl ether. The
peptides were resuspended in 0.1% TFA, lyophilized and resuspended
in 0.1% TFA again. The peptides are neutralized by dilution into 50
mM Tris buffer pH 7.5 before immobilization.

Preparing Peptide Arrays
Peptide arrays were prepared
as described previously.13,16 Briefly, steel plates
were evaporated with 384 gold spots. The plates were soaked in an
alkanethiolate solution that self-assembles onto the gold surfaces.
The alkanethiolate monolayers presented a functional maleimide group
against a background of tri(ethylene glycol). Peptides were transferred
onto the gold spots using Tecan robotics and incubated at room temperature
for 1 h for immobilization. Peptide immobilization occurs through
conjugate addition of the thiol on the terminal cysteine residue to
the maleimide.

SAMDI Mass Spectrometry
The SAMDI
peptide array plates
were coated with a 10 mg/mL 2′,4′,6′-trihydroxyacetophenone
(THAP) MALDI matrix in acetonitrile. Each immobilized peptide was
analyzed in the reflector positive mode with 900 shots on an AB Sciex
TOF/TOF 5800 MALDI mass spectrometer.

Statistical Testing to
Identify Amino Acids Associated with
High or Low S/N
The S/N of all peptides were calculated by
dividing the integrated product (area under the curve) of the expected
peptide peaks (the signal) by the integrated product of a region in
the spectrum devoid of peaks (the noise). The S/N for each peptide were sorted and ranked from lowest to
highest. The S/N increase for consecutive
peptides was calculated, and the low region boundary was defined as
when a large change in S/N increase
occurs. Similarly, a high S/N region
was identified with the same process. This method allows different
sizes for low and high regions. Amino acid enrichment in either region
was determined using the Fischer exact test, which calculates the
probability to observe at least as many amino acids in the region.
Since there were 361 peptides, the significance threshold was determined
by a Bonferroni corrected p-value cutoff of 10–4 (approximately 0.05/361); all reported p-values
define the likelihood that the observed number of amino acids is within
the low or high regions by random chance.

Machine Learning Methods
We considered a variety of
linear and nonlinear supervised techniques: partial least-squares
regression (PLSR), random forests, deep learning, support vector machines
(SVM), and nearest neighbor regression. Random forest outperformed
PLSR (in terms of Q2) because PLSR can
only model linear relationships. Deep learning, SVMs, and nearest
neighbor regression all require parameter tuning, which if done improperly,
commonly led to poor performance (zero or even negative Q2 values). Additionally, the multiple training/testing
of different feature sets would usually require many iterations of
parameter tuning, hindering our analysis. However, the training parameters
of random forest typically require little to no tuning, and we found
that it outperformed other methods while requiring less human guidance.

Random forest is a commonly used nonlinear supervised learning
model that is an aggregation of individual decision trees.34,36 Decision trees are composed of multiple levels of “if-then”
statements to segment data. For example, if high amino acid polarity
leads to high S/N, then a decision
tree would identify appropriate thresholds, alpha and beta, and create
the rule: “If polarity > alpha, then S/N > beta”. This rule segments the data based on
high/low
polarity. Each decision tree is distinct as it is trained on a random
subset of the data, selecting a fraction of the total number of rows
and columns of the data matrix. This sampling has a 2-fold benefit:
it avoids overfitting data and increases generalizability of the aggregated
model. Random forest also has a low barrier for implementation due
to existing toolboxes that can be used off-the-shelf. We used the
randomForest library in the freely available software environment
R, version 3.3.1. The common usage of random forest, in combination
with its ease of use, provided an ideal framework for this study.

Computational Development
All data analysis and model
training was performed in the freely available statistical software
environment R, version 3.3.1. All code is documented in the following
public git repository: https://github.com/xuebert/ML_SN_SAMDI_AChem. A generalized graphical user interface has been developed to visualize
data in a bubble chart framework; this GUI is provided at https://github.com/xuebert/bubble_chart_app.

Results and Discussion
Experimental Design
We calculated
peptide S/N using SAMDI mass spectrometry
in two peptide
arrays: Ac-GRKacXZC (K-array) and Ac-GXZHGC (H-array),
where X and Z represent all combinations
of 19 amino acids (cysteine omitted) for a total of 361 peptides in
each array. To investigate the relationships between specific amino
acids and S/N, we conducted statistical
tests and machine learning. For each array, we trained a machine learning
model with randomly chosen groups of peptides consisting of 5 to 350
peptides to discover patterns and make predictions of peptide S/N based on amino acid sequences. Through
subsequent machine learning analysis, we identified physical properties
and amino acid positions that are useful in predicting the peptide’s
observed S/N. We applied the corresponding
results to a published peptide array data set to reveal how S/N information can inform and serve as
a guide for experimental design and analysis. In doing so, we discovered
specific amino acid interactions that can explain observed S/N-amino acid relationships. From analysis
of both arrays, we found that the machine learning models need to
be trained on only 1/3 of peptides in each array to make accurate
predictions of peptide S/N.

Preparation
of Peptide Arrays and S/N Data Collection
We used solid-phase peptide synthesis
to synthesize two peptide libraries containing terminal-cysteine residues,
Ac-GRKacXZC (K-array) and Ac-GXZHGC (H-array), where X
and Z represent all amino acids except cysteine for a total of 361
peptides in each array. Steel plates with 384 gold spots were soaked
in a solution of disulfides as described earlier.9 The monolayers self-assembled onto the gold surfaces and
presented a functional maleimide group allowing for the immobilization
of thiol-containing molecules. We treated each monolayer surface with
a unique peptide, which was immobilized to the surface through the
side-chain thiol of the terminal cysteine residues. Eleven identical
arrays were printed for the experiments that follow. We collected
spectra for each immobilized peptide for both arrays on an AB Sciex
5800 MALDI mass spectrometer using reflector positive mode. Noise
was quantified as the area under the curve (AUC) of the mass spectrum
in a region devoid of signals, and the peptide signal was quantified
as AUC of the expected peptide-terminated alkanethiol mass minus the
noise AUC. Finally, we calculated S/N as the peptide’s signal AUC divided by the noise AUC and
calculated the mean for each peptide over the 11 plates in each array.

S/N is Attributable to Single
Amino Acids in the K-Array
Comprehensive analysis of the
K-array revealed general trends of single amino acids in a peptide
on the observed S/N for that peptide. We used the Fischer exact test
(Bonferroni corrected p < 10–4) to determine whether peptides with low or high S/N were enriched
with specific amino acids. The corresponding p-values
reflect the probability that the observed number of amino acids is
within either the low or high S/N region by random chance (gray regions in Figure 2A). All p-values are reported
in Supporting Information Figures 1 and
2. We found enrichment of peptides with X-position tryptophan and
leucine in the low S/N region and
enrichment of peptides with Z-position glycine in the high S/N region (Figure 2B). This result suggests that single amino
acids can have a strong effect on a peptide’s detectability
in MALDI-MS. The exceptionally low S/N of tryptophan and leucine-containing peptides suggest that their
S/N-lowering effect is particularly strong, further suggesting that
future K-arrays can disregard tryptophan and leucine while favoring
glycine.

Figure 2 Low peptide S/N is observed in
peptides containing tryptophan and leucine and aspartic acid and glutamic
acid. Peptide S/N was averaged over
11 control plates. (A) Peptides in the K-array were sorted according
to S/N. Low/high S/N regions are identified (see Methods). S/N ranges from
3.8 to 313.7, demonstrating that peptides vary greatly in S/N. (B) Amino acids found in the low/high
regions were found to be statistically significant (Bonferroni corrected p < 10–4) using a Fischer exact test.
The reported p-value is the chance the observed number of amino acids
is within the low or high region by random chance. Peptides with X-position
tryptophan and leucine have statistically low S/N, and peptides with Z-position glycine have statistically
high S/N. Peptides that have X-position
alanine are not statistically significant and are representative of
other amino acids. Panels C and D describe the same methods for the
H-array. S/N has a similarly large
range for both arrays, but the differences in amino acids observations
suggest that dissimilar mechanisms are responsible for S/N.

Peptides in the K-array display a wide range of S/N—from 3.8 to 313.7 (S/N is unitless)—demonstrating a wide range of poorly
detectable to detectable peptides (Figure 2A). Combined with the statistical tests,
this result suggests that poorly detectable peptides can be predicted
by their sequence. This observation may explain differences in MS-detectable
peptide fragments after protein digestion.30,31 In MS-based proteomics experiments, proteins are commonly digested
and the fragments are detected using mass spectrometry. It is rare
for complete detection of all peptide sequences after digestion,32,33 and incorporation of known poorly detectable peptide information
could increase confidence of protein observation. As we demonstrate,
characterization of a MALDI-MS experimental pipeline with known peptide
sequences can inform subsequent protein quantification experiments.

Machine Learning Model Predicts SAMDI-MS S/N as a Function of Amino Acid Sequence
We developed
a machine learning model to predict the S/N of peptide-terminated alkanethiolates in the SAMDI spectrum
based on amino acid sequence with high accuracy suggesting that amino
acid composition drives S/N observations
in a predictive manner. We trained a random forest34 machine learning model to predict S/N based on the hydrophilic, steric, and electronic physical
properties of amino acids.35 The training
data contained 361 peptides (rows) and 39 associated physical properties
for each of the X- or Z-position amino acids (resulting in 78 columns).
The response vector, or predicted variable, defines the mean S/N from the 11 control plates.

We
used cross-validation, where a data sample (randomly selected rows)
is left out for model testing, to calculate the predictive power Q2 statistic37  In this formulation, yi is the true S/N for the left-out
test peptide i, ŷi is the predicted S/N of the test peptide, y̅train is
the sample mean of S/N in the training set, and n is the number of cross-validated test peptides. The Q2 statistic can take on values from −∞
to 1, where 1 represents perfect prediction and 0 is equivalent to
random performance. Cross-validation effectively simulates a partially
synthesized array. By training on a randomly selected subset of peptides
and testing simulated predictions on the remaining data, cross-validation
mimics the process of experimentally validating peptide-S/N relationships. We create an explicit null model
for each case by randomizing the data values prior to model training;
the average Q2 value of the null case
was about 0.

The K-array analysis resulted in a Q2 of 0.59 using both X- and Z-positions and all 39 amino
acid physical
properties. The high Q2 value confirms
our hypothesis that S/N values can
be reliably predicted from amino acid sequences. This performance
further suggests that S/N of new
amino acids, such as non-natural amino acids, can be predicted using
their known physical properties. Together these results strongly indicate
that amino acid sequence influences S/N in MALDI-MS. However, the inability to acquire a Q2 value closer to 1 suggests that hidden variables—such
as chemical interactions with amino acids outside the X- and Z-positions—play
an important role in the overall response. These interactions are
challenging to take into account, as they cannot be characterized
with physical properties alone.

Bubble Chart Illustrates
the S/N as an Experimental Design
Parameter
As a measure of data
quality, the S/N becomes another
experimental design parameter. When studying enzyme activity on SAMDI
peptide arrays, we measure the extent of peptide conversion with the
enzyme.15 Enzyme-treated peptides can be
sorted into four categories: (i) high enzyme activity and high S/N, (ii) high enzyme activity and low S/N, (iii) low enzyme activity and high S/N, and (iv) low enzyme activity and low S/N. In the past, the SAMDI peptide array
data was compiled into heat-maps that portrayed only enzymatic activity.
We wanted to incorporate a metric into SAMDI array data output to
differentiate between peptides that offer reliable and valuable information
(category i from those of lesser importance).

To this end, we
include S/N information to complement
a previously published experiment.15 We
construct a bubble chart where each peptide is represented by a circle,
whose color represents the extent of peptide conversion to the product,
and whose size represents normalized S/N of the peptide before enzyme treatment. Previous approaches that
use a color-only heatmap give the impression that each data point
is equally valid in an analysis of the array data. However, some of
the peptides contribute information that is more reliable because
they have smaller errors. Observed enzyme activity on a peptide does
not always correlate to significance. By incorporating S/N in bubble size, we rule out low performance signals
and focus the analysis on high S/N ones. We illustrate this approach by replotting the heatmaps from
Kuo et al.15 to include S/N (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Heatmap of cell lysate deacetylation activity and S/N highlights trustworthy peptides. Bubble color
is based on deacetylase activities from Kuo et al.9 for lysate treated ac-GRKacXZKC peptide arrays.
Bubble area represents peptide S/N before lysate treatment, normalized by max S/N. Amino acids are sorted by their general trend in peptide S/N when in either X- or Z-position. Peptides
containing tryptophan (W), arginine (R), methionine (M), and lysine
(K) have consistently low S/N, regardless
of position. This illustration emphasizes peptides that are both active
in terms of enzymatic activity and reliable in terms of S/N. In contrast, the highest activity peptides (darkest
in color) do not necessarily give the highest S/N (largest bubble).

In Kuo et al.,15 the K-array was
exposed
to cell lysates, and endogenous deacetylase activity was quantified
by measuring the fraction of deacetylated peptides with MALDI mass
spectrometry.15 Deacetylation activity
was quantified as the AUC of the modified (deacetylated) peptide divided
by the AUC of both modified and unmodified peptides. AUC of each peptide
is the sum of the three background-subtracted ion peaks in MALDI-MS:
H+, Na+, and K+.

This new analysis revealed additional insights
into the previous
data. Peptides containing amino acids tryptophan, leucine, arginine,
methionine, and lysine reflect low S/N, suggesting that their activity profiles are less useful. Conversely,
peptides containing proline, glutamic acid, and glycine reflect high S/N, suggesting that their activity profiles
are more useful. Peptides containing leucine exhibit low S/N exclusively in the X-position, demonstrating
that certain amino acids can have positional effects on S/N. Though amino acid presence can largely explain
a peptide’s S/N, we also
find that some peptides have inexplicably low S/N—such as KAA, KIT, and KIQ—despite general
trends suggesting that these peptides should have high S/N. This peculiarity highlights the complexities
in S/N and reinforces the utility
of machine learning strategies to predict S/N, which can be a critical design factor for future arrays.

Testing for S/N does not supplant
tightly controlled and validated peptide array experiments. Instead,
we suggest that accounting for unknown influences that lower confidence
of a signal’s true value—such as peptide synthesis inefficiencies,
side reactions, peptide loss from washing, or ionization efficiencies—can
better guide experimental design and data analysis. These influences
are especially complicated with peptide species, where it is not clear
how different amino acid sequences affect S/N. Machine learning can easily account for such effects.

Low S/N Peptides Offer Unrepresentative
Signals
The experiments by Kuo et al. demonstrated that low S/N peptides have higher variance across
replicates. The same K-array measurements were carried out on two
time points and across three different cellular conditions. We compared
the variance in replicates of peptides in the top 20% of S/N to those in the bottom 20%. A one-sided F-test
verified that the top 20% peptides have lower replicate variance than
the lower 20% across all three conditions and across both time points
(p < 10–10 for all cases). This
finding suggests that peptides with low S/N have unrepresentative (or possibly random) signals, and
they should be weighted less during analysis to avoid misled conclusions.
To investigate further, we calculated the standard deviation of deacetylase
activity on each peptide and plotted it against S/N (Supporting Information Figure 3A); peptides with lower S/N have a higher variance in deacetylase activity. This trend was consistent
for all days and for all experimental conditions, with a high anticorrelation
coefficient (ranging from −0.814 to −0.975, Supporting Information Figure 3B), demonstrating
that peptides with low S/N can give
unrepresentative measurements.

S/N is Attributable to Single
Amino Acids in the H-Array
We investigate the H-array, Ac-GXZHGC,
to analyze the generalizability of our findings; that is, do S/N characteristics of peptides from the
K-array also apply to other peptide arrays? Similar to the K-array,
the H-array has a wide range of S/N values, ranging from 5.5 to 255 (Figure 2C and 2D), reinforcing
the fact that peptides span a wide range of nondetectable to detectable
signals in MALDI. The statistically low S/N peptides contain aspartic acid and/or glutamic acid, suggesting
that their synthesis may be unnecessary in future experiments. Peptides
with phenylalanine have statistically high S/N values suggesting that additional phenylalanine may improve
peptide signals in the H-array.

Context Matters: S/N Characteristics
Are Inconsistent between the K-Array and H-Array
In addition
to the variable composition of amino acids, the surrounding amino
acids (those not in the X- or Z-position) play a role. Within the
same array, S/N appears consistent
between positions (Supporting Information Figure 4), suggesting that S/N remains largely unchanged when amino acid substitutions are made
in the X- or Z-positions. However, peptides that had the lowest S/N in the K-array contained tryptophan,
arginine and methionine; those with the lowest S/N in the H array had aspartic acid and glutamic acid. This
disparity demonstrates that S/N characteristics
in one array can be contextual and are not always consistent with
a different array (Figure 4). This observation suggests that the outside amino acids—arginine
and lysine in the K-array and histidine in the H-array—strongly
influence SAMDI peptide detection. In other words, the amino acid
context around X- and Z-positions influences overall peptide detection,
and partial knowledge of amino acid sequence is insufficient in understanding S/N values. This finding suggests that
future SAMDI arrays require individual peptide–S/N characterization, and current understanding of
mass spectrometric peptide–S/N relationships is insufficient to design a peptide array a priori.

Figure 4 Amino
acid influence is context dependent. Amino acids are sorted
by their correlated mean peptide S/N in the K-array when in either X- or Z-positions. Bars represent S/N normalized by the highest value within
each array. The H-array shows little agreement, suggesting that the
surrounding amino acids strongly influence S/N. The two negatively charged amino acids, aspartic and
glutamic acid, have the largest difference between the two arrays,
suggesting a relation between charge and S/N, but only within the H-array.

Physical Interactions Help Inform S/N Differences
S/N differences
can arise from a variety of sources, including synthesis
inefficiencies, side reactions, and poor MALDI-MS ionization. Peptides
with both methionine and tryptophan have low S/N in the K-array, and both have shown sensitivity to oxidation,27,28 sequestering the relevant peaks and lowering signal strength. However,
Lee and co-workers demonstrated greater oxidation of histidine than
either methionine or tryptophan,38 and
Stafford and co-workers reported similar findings in oxidation of
histidine in peptide arrays.27 Their results
are contrary to our lack of observed histidine oxidation (or low S/N) in either array, which remains unexplained.

In contrast to the K-array where methionine and tryptophan associate
with the lowest S/N, glutamic acid
and aspartic acid have the lowest S/N in the H-array (Figure 4). Lysine has strongly favorable hydrogen bonding energies,39 and when in close vicinity of methionine and
tryptophan, hydrogen bonding could catalyze oxidation.39,40 Tryptophan-containing peptides have statistically low S/N specifically when in the X-position (Figure 2), which is directly
adjacent to the lysine and further supports this hypothesis. If hydrogen
bonding stabilization is required for methionine or tryptophan oxidation,
then the presence of carboxylic acid groups on acidic amino acids
may be unfavorable for oxidation. To explore this concept further,
we compared methionine or tryptophan containing K-array peptides with
either glutamic or aspartic acid to those without glutamic or aspartic
acid. We applied a Mann–Whitney U test and found that peptides
with one of methionine or tryptophan and one of glutamic or aspartic
acid had higher S/N values (p = 0.0050) than peptides with methionine or tryptophan
without either glutamic or aspartic acid, maybe indicating that the
two acidic amino acids protect against methionine and tryptophan oxidation.

High S/N peptides in the K-array
commonly contain hydrophilic amino acids, such as glutamic acid, asparagine,
and glutamine, potentially because of more efficient crystallization
within the matrix. This finding is in agreement with a report by Fenselau
and co-workers, where hydrophilic proteins were preferentially detected
in MALDI-MS due to differences in the cocrystallization.21 However, the H-array has high S/N associated with hydrophobic amino acids: proline,
tyrosine, phenylalanine, and isoleucine. The divergence in S/N of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino
acids suggests that mechanisms leading to high S/N are different between the two arrays.

A two sided
Mann–Whitney U test (Bonferroni corrected p < 2.6 × 10–3) reveals peptides
that contain eight amino acids in the X- or Z-position that have statistically
different S/N values between the
two arrays: glutamic acid, tryptophan, aspartic acid, methionine,
arginine, lysine, glycine, and phenylalanine. This test directly compares
differences between the two arrays rather than within the array, which
has resulted in more amino acids than the Fischer exact test in Figure 2. Only arginine and
phenylalanine differ from Figure 2, and both amino acids have lower S/N in the K-array. This result contrasts with those
of Krause and co-workers where peptides with higher numbers of arginine
or phenylalanine typically contributed to higher MALDI signal strength25 (the K-array has an additional arginine). The
unusual observation may be due to an unknown interaction with other
outside amino acids, indicating that peptide S/N should be tested for each peptide array.

Machine Learning
Performance Across Positions and Physical Properties
Help Explain S/N Observations
We trained random forest models with individual physical properties
to assess the impact each property has on S/N. Highly predictive properties (namely, those with highest Q2) suggest that the associated physical property
is highly relevant and predictive of SAMDI-MS S/N. In addition, we independently evaluated the X- and Z-positions
to see if one position reflected more predictive power. Positional
differences suggest that the amino acid position, and not merely composition,
influences the predictive power of our machine learning model.

Using both X- and Z-positions and all physical properties, the K-array
and H-array had a Q2 of 0.59 and 0.61,
respectively (Figure 5). The similar Q2 values suggest that
the models reached an upper limit to predictive performance from amino
acid sequence. Predictions based on the amino acids in both X- and
Z- positions consistently performed better than predictions based
solely on one position: Q2 = 0.22 and
0.20 for the X- and Z-positions in the K-array, respectively, and Q2 = 0.16 and 0.28 in the X- and Z-positions
of the H-array, respectively. As expected, more complete amino acid
information results in better prediction. However, the higher Q2 for the Z-position in the H-array suggests
that positions can have varied influence on S/N. This observation suggests that the Z-position interacts
with the histidine to change S/N detection in MALDI-MS more strongly than the X-position. In addition,
the highest single property Q2 values—0.57
and 0.54 in the K- and H-array, respectively—are close to the Q2 value of all properties. This observation
indicates that few properties are necessary to predict S/N and that many physical properties are redundant.

Figure 5 Peptide S/N is predicted as a
function of amino acid properties. Peptide S/N was predicted using a random forest machine learning model
based on 39 amino acid physical properties, shown in diamonds, of
the amino acid in either the X-position (red), Z-position (blue),
or both (purple). Also, models were fit on individual properties to
identify their predictive power, shown in circles. Random forest models
contained 1000 trees and the predictive power, quantified by the Q2 metric, was calculated based on 5-fold cross-validation.
All Q2 values are listed in Supporting Information Tables 1 and 2. Consistent
for both peptide arrays, the highest Q2 values were attained when using both positions with all physical
properties (purple diamond). Z-position Q2 values (blue) are higher in the H-array, which suggests that positions
have varied predictive power on S/N. In addition, most properties
lie near the diagonal indicating that they have similar predictive
power between peptide arrays; the amino acid disagreement in Figure 4, however, suggests
that those properties are predictive for different reasons.

In terms of physical properties
(39 total), we do find both consistent
and inconsistent trends for the two arrays. Electronic properties
(15 total) tend to be less predictive for both arrays than steric
or hydrophilic properties (Supporting Information Tables 1 and 2). Steric properties (16 total) and hydrophilic properties
(8 total) are especially highly predictive in the K- and H-arrays,
respectively. Hydrophilic properties are highly predictive in the
H-array potentially due to the hydrophilicity of glutamic and aspartic
acid and their association with low S/N exclusively in the H-array. Similarly, hydrophobic amino acids like
proline, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and isoleucine tend to have high S/N. This alignment explains why hydrophilic
properties are predictive in the H-array. However, it is unclear why
electronic properties are relatively less predictive while steric
properties are more predictive in the K-array.

Despite these
differences, physical properties are similarly predictive
between the K-array and H-array (Figure 5), as evident in their closeness to the diagonal.
That is, a predictive or nonpredictive property remains largely the
same between arrays, but there still exist small differences between
the performance of steric and hydrophilic properties between arrays.
This relation demonstrates that the same properties govern S/N observations, but because single amino
acids differ in S/N characteristics
(Figure 4), these results
altogether suggest that S/N values
manifest from different mechanisms between the arrays. These different
mechanisms are likely a direct result of context differences, specifically
relating to the outside amino acids.

Machine Learning Cannot
Predict S/N on Completely Unknown
Peptide Arrays
We trained various
machine learning models on the K-peptide array and tested them on
the H-array, and vice versa, to assess the feasibility of predicting S/N on a de novo peptide array. We trained
models for every positional combination to interrogate exhaustively
the entire space. For example, we trained a model on X-position data
in the K-array, then testing on the Z-position in the H-array, and
we continued with all combinations of positions. We also trained several
types of models to gauge whether common machine learning models can
predict S/N on different arrays:
random forest,34 deep learning,41 nearest neighbor regression,42 and partial least-squares regression.43 The models had the following model-specific parameters:
random forest had 1000 trees, deep learning consisted of two layers
of 200 nodes with feed-forward connections; nearest neighbors regression
used 10 neighbors; and partial least-squares regression used one component,
or loading vector.

All models trained on the K-array failed
to predict S/N in the H-array, and
vice versa (Q2 < 0.1). This failure
is attributable to S/N disagreement
between peptide arrays for each amino acid (Figure 4), which arises from the unique outside amino
acids in the two arrays (GRKacXZC and GXZHGC). This finding reinforces the idea that context matters: interactions
with outside amino acids influence S/N, and that peptide–S/N relationships
within one array do not always generalize to other arrays. While these
results do not present general rules for peptide S/N predictions on new arrays, we have developed
a method that will be invaluable for designing and preparing new SAMDI
peptide arrays. This work introduces a strategy to identify the specific
rules of a given array.

Only 1/3 of Peptides in an Array Are Required
for Machine Learning
Model Prediction of Peptide S/N
We investigated the minimum number of peptides in an array needed
to train a model that could accurately predict S/N of the full array. We simulated a partially synthesized
array by randomly selecting subsets of peptides from each array to
train the machine learning model to predict S/N of the nonselected peptides. The number of randomly selected
training peptides ranged from 5 to 350, and each training size contained
200 repetitions of selecting random peptides. We trained a random
forest model with all 39 physical properties in both amino acid positions.
The null model with randomized data performed consistently around Q2 = 0. We identified the point of diminishing
returns, which balances minimum training size with maximum predictive
power, by normalizing the number of training peptides and finding
the sample size closest to training size 1 and Q2 = 1. The point of diminishing returns was found to be 87
and 111 peptides for the K-array and H-array, respectively, both of
which had a Q2 = 0.48 (shown with arrows
in Figure 6). In other
words, as the number of training peptides used increases, the Q2 (predictive power) increases until 87 peptides
are used in the K-array and 111 peptides are used in the H-array,
when Q2 becomes roughly constant. This
result shows that we can partially screen future peptide arrays by
synthesizing only about 100 of the planned 361-sized array, or roughly
one-third, reducing the use of resources and time. Though we cannot
generalize this specific ratio to larger array sizes, these results
suggest that only a fraction of peptides in a given array need to
be synthesized to identify the rules of that array, and the remaining
synthesis can be tailored based on those specific rules. This machine
learning technique can prevent costly experimental screens and assist
researchers optimize the design of future arrays.

Figure 6 Peptide array S/N can be predicted
from a minimal peptide subsample. A specified number of peptides were
randomly selected for training to predict S/N of the remaining peptides using all physical properties
of both X- and Z-position amino acids. Because of computational constraints,
random forest was used with 100 trees for training set sizes from
5 to 350. The median Q2 and 80% confidence
intervals are shown for 200 random training sets. For both peptide
arrays, predictive power increases with training size and levels out
around 100 peptides. The optimal trade-off was identified by normalizing
the number of training peptides and finding the sample size closest
to training size 1 and Q2 = 1. The trade-off
is shown with arrows: 87 training peptides for K-array and 111 for
H-array, which demonstrates that machine learning can predict S/N for future peptide arrays, avoiding
costly experiments that screen for high S/N peptides. A randomized data set performed consistently
around Q2 = 0.

Conclusions
There are significant variations in the
intensities of peaks in
SAMDI mass spectrometry that can arise from different peptide sequences.
SAMDI analysis of peptide arrays demonstrates that peptide signals
can have a wide range of S/N, where
many of the peptides are nearly undetectable. We find that S/N is attributable to single amino acids,
offering design choices to increase information content. However,
the underlying basis of S/N is unclear
and may be due to complex interactions among amino acids, matrix,
crystallization, or ionization efficiencies. Additionally, we find
that the two arrays used in this work exhibited different S/N values for different amino acids, demonstrating
that the whole amino acid sequence can affect S/N values in MALDI-MS. Machine learning identified physical
properties that predict S/N with
high accuracy. Machine learning models can be trained on a fraction
of the peptide sequences and still describe the full set of sequences,
allowing early selection of high S/N peptides. Such computational models allow for the design of arrays
consisting of only high S/N peptides
without costly screens or unnecessary peptide library syntheses. Additionally,
accounting for S/N as a design choice
can prevent inaccurate results drawn from poor peptide measurements.

This work significantly improves and simplifies high-throughput
data analysis by factoring in data quality. The statistical and machine
learning methods presented here allow us to discover the most valuable
information from peptide arrays and plan future experiments with more
confidence. As demonstrated, these methods can inform the design of
new peptide arrays using a small set of presynthesized peptides. The
presented methodology and applications of S/N are adapted to maximize the information learned from peptide
array experiments and can improve peptide design across a wide range
of technologies.
