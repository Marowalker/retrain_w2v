A direct, ambient ionization method
has been developed for the
determination of creatinine in urine that combines derivatization
and thermal desorption with extractive electrospray ionization and
ion mobility-mass spectrometry. The volatility of creatinine was enhanced
by a rapid on-probe aqueous acylation reaction, using a custom-made
thermal desorption probe, allowing thermal desorption and ionization
of the monoacylated derivative. The monoacyl creatinine [M + H]+ ion (m/z 156) was subjected
to mass-to-charge selection and collision induced dissociation to
remove the acyl group, generating the protonated creatinine [M + H]+ product ion at m/z 114
before an ion mobility separation was applied to reduce chemical noise.
Stable isotope dilution using creatinine-d3 as internal standard was used for quantitative measurements. The
direct on-probe derivatization allows high sample throughput with
a typical cycle time of 1 min per sample. The method shows good linearity
(R2 = 0.986) and repeatability (%RSD 8–10%)
in the range of 0.25–2.0 mg/mL. The creatinine concentrations
in diluted urine samples from a healthy individual were determined
to contain a mean concentration of 1.44 mg/mL creatinine with a precision
(%RSD) of 9.9%. The reactive ambient ionization approach demonstrated
here has potential for the determination of involatile analytes in
urine and other biofluids.

==== Body
Thermal desorption
is a commonly
used method for the generation of gaseous phase analytes from less
volatile matrix components. The process of directly heating a sample
to liberate molecules from the liquid phase has been widely applied
to the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by headspace
gas chromatography (GC).1 Other applications
of thermal desorption include headspace analysis by mass spectrometry
(MS)2 and narcotic/explosive detection
by ion mobility (IM) spectrometry.3 The
application of thermal desorption is limited by the volatility of
the target analyte, which can be altered by specific derivatization
reactions.4−6

The substitution reactions of alkylation, acylation,
and silylation5 can significantly reduce
the temperatures required
for thermal desorption of a molecule. However, these reactions are
generally carried out in a nonaqueous environment. The process of
removing the water from a sample prior to derivatization enables a
wide range of derivatization reactions to be carried out but significantly
increases the sample preparation time required for each analysis.
The use of aqueous based derivatization reactions overcomes the difficulties
associated with aqueous samples, allowing direct derivatization.6 The use of aqueous derivatization reactions for
the detection of compounds in urine has been an area of interest,
particularly in the analysis of drugs of abuse,7,8 but
the technique is still in its infancy for biomedical prognostic/diagnostic
applications.9

The direct analysis
of urine by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
is problematic, because of ion suppression effects arising from the
high salt content of urine.10 Prior separation
by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or GC, hyphenated
with MS, is therefore usually used for the detection of excreted metabolites
relating to disease states such as lung disorder, diabetes, and cancer.11−13 It is common practice in the determination of urinary metabolites
to normalize the target molecule concentration to the excretion of
creatinine.14 The normalization process
allows the absolute amount of an excreted metabolite to be expressed
in relation to the creatinine level (i.e., μg/g creatinine)
which can then be used as a comparison against a healthy population.
The concentration of creatinine in both urine and blood serum is dependent
on several variables, including the glomerular filtration rate, which
is itself dependent on age, gender, and body size.15,16 The measurement of the creatinine clearance rate (CrCl), the amount
of creatinine passed in 24 h, determines the glomerular filtration
rate (GFR) which also provides information on kidney function.

A variety of methods are
available for the determination of creatinine
(I, below) in urine, the most widely used being the Jaffe
reaction.17

This colorimetric based approach places serum or urine in
an alkaline
environment to facilitate the reaction between creatinine and picric
acid to form red/orange crystals. The poor specificity of the Jaffe
reaction limits its use, particularly in serum, and has therefore
been modified numerous times to increase the specificity of the method.18 Other methods include a two-step enzymatic digestion
of creatinine,19 which has higher selectivity
compared to the Jaffe reaction but is limited by a complex multiple
step sample preparation procedure and involves ion exchange chromatography.20 Creatinine determination in complex biofluids
has been previously performed by GC/MS with isotope dilution, using
a derivatization step to increase analyte volatility.21 The direct determination of urinary creatinine levels by
extractive electrospray (EESI)-tandem mass spectrometry has also been
demonstrated,22 showing that ambient ionization
can be used to measure urinary creatinine with high sensitivity. However,
this approach does not separate the target analyte from the urine
matrix prior to ionization and may be susceptible to interference
and ion suppression effects. Thermal desorption of a volatile target
molecule allows ionization by EESI23 while
discriminating against the urinary salts and other underivatized metabolites.
Here, the combination of a rapid aqueous phase derivatization to promote
desorption of an involatile analyte directly from the urine matrix,
combined with EESI and ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) of the
volatile derivative, is demonstrated for the determination of creatinine.
This approach has wider application as an ambient ionization method
for the rapid, direct quantitation of involatile urinary analytes
unaffected by ion suppression from salts and other components.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
Analytical grade water and methanol were
purchased from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK). HPLC grade formic
acid, acetic anhydride (99%), and creatinine (98%) were purchased
from Sigma Aldrich (Gillingham, UK). Creatinine-d3 was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (Ontario,
Canada). All chemicals were used without further purification.

AP/TD
Probe
A schematic diagram of the ion source region
of a Waters Synapt HDMS spectrometer (Waters, Manchester, UK), modified
in-house for direct on-probe reactive derivatization (R-TD) and extractive
electrospray is shown in Figure 1.24 The TD probe was constructed by placing a cylindrical
heater cartridge (2.5 mm o.d. × 50 mm; RS Components Ltd., Northants,
UK) into a stainless steel tube (12 i.d. × 300 mm) with the heater
positioned inside an aluminum adaptor at the probe tip. Samples and
the derivatization reagent were injected into a brass sample holder
(2.5 mm o.d. × 10 mm) located within the aluminum adaptor, with
the base of the sample holder in direct contact with the heater cartridge.
The sample holder was inserted through a hole in the side of a stainless
steel tube (12 mm o.d. × 50 mm) located between the ESI probe
and the mass spectrometer inlet cone that spatially confines the thermally
desorbed analytes for ionization by an in-line electrospray plume.
The cartridge temperature was regulated using a temperature controller
(Tempatron, Reading UK) to set the sample holder temperature to 100
°C.

Sample Preparation
Creatinine standards
were prepared
in water at concentrations in the range of 2.5–20 μg/mL
(60 μL). Urine samples were diluted with water (1:100), and
deuterated creatinine-d3 was added at
a concentration of 5 μg/mL (40 μL). In preliminary creatinine
acylation experiments, urine was mixed with acetic anhydride (100
μL) at a 1:1 ratio to initiate the acylation reaction. The samples
were continually agitated, and aliquots (10 μL) of the reaction
mixture were removed, diluted in 50:50 methanol/water (1:10) with
0.1% formic acid, and directly infused into the ESI source of the
mass spectrometer. On-probe derivatization was carried out by the
direct injection of a mixture of diluted urine (10 μL of a 1:100
dilution in water), containing the creatinine-d3 internal standard, and acetic anhydride (10 μL) into
the sample holder of the TD probe, which was preheated to 100 °C.

EESI-IM-MS/MS Conditions
The EESI solvent consisted
of 50:50 MeOH/H2O (v/v) with 0.1% formic acid (v/v), which
was infused from a syringe pump at a flow rate of 10 μL/min.
The mass spectrometer (Synapt HDMS, Waters, Manchester, UK) was operated
in sensitivity (V) mode using positive ionization with a capillary
voltage of 2.8 kV and a cone voltage of 15 V; a mass range of m/z 50–500 was monitored. The source
temperature was set to 120 °C, with a nebulizer gas flow (N2) of 60 L/h. The quadrupole was set to transmit the monoacylated
creatinine ([M + H]+ = m/z 156) and creatinine-d3 ([M + H]+ = m/z 159) ions. The trap
region of the Waters Tri-Wave cell was set to 13 V for collision induced
dissociation of the mass-selected precursor ions using N2 as the collision gas. The traveling wave ion mobility (TWIM) cell
wave height was 6 V; the wave velocity was 300 m/s, and the N2 drift gas was set to 30 mL/min. The TOF pusher pulse interval
was 45 μs/scan; 200 TOF scans were taken per IM spectrum providing
a drift time range of 0–9 ms.

Results and Discussion
The aqueous derivatization of urinary creatinine by acetic anhydride
was initially investigated off-line using urine spiked with creatinine-d3. The resulting solution was mixed 1:1 with
acetic anhydride and allowed to react at room temperature for 3 h.
Aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed, diluted, and directly
infused into the ESI source of the mass spectrometer. The [M + H]+ responses for the monoacylated urinary creatinine and creatinine-d3 were observed at m/z 156 and m/z 159, respectively
(Figure 2), demonstrating the derivatization
of creatinine in an aqueous environment. The monoacylated ions were
mass-selected and fragmented by collision-induced dissociation, resulting
in the formation of fragment ions at m/z 114 and 117, which correspond to protonated creatinine and creatinine-d3, following loss of the acetyl group, confirming
the identification of the monoacyl derivatives. The direct infusion
data also shows two unidentified ions present at m/z 135 and 153, associated with the urine matrix.

spectrum showing the CID fragmentation of the [M + H]+ ions
of monoacylated creatinine and creatinine-d3 (m/z 156 and 159,
respectively) post-three hour reaction generating the protonated creatinine
and creatinine-d3 product ions at m/z 114 and 117.

The direct on-probe acylation of urinary creatinine was tested
under thermal desorption conditions on the TD probe to determine the
volatility of the monoacyl derivative. An aliquot of diluted urine
was mixed with acetic anhydride (1:1) and immediately injected into
the preheated (100 °C) TD probe sample holder. The vapor plume
generated by TD was contained by the stainless steel tube interface
(Figure 1) and ionized by interaction of the
vaporized analytes with the electrospray droplets, a process that
has been termed as extractive electrospray.25

The direct reactive derivatization-thermal desorption (R-TD)
of
urinary creatinine in the presence of acetic anhydride generates a
near instantaneous response for the monoacylcreatinine ([M + H]+m/z 156) and the protonated
creatinine fragment ion (m/z 114).
Injection of an aliquot of urine without acetic anhydride resulted
in a small baseline response with a peak area <0.4% of the response
in the presence of the derivatizing agent. These results show that
the acylation significantly increases the volatility of creatinine
from a decomposition point of ∼300 °C to less than the
TD probe temperature of 100 °C and that the reaction is sufficiently
rapid to allow direct on-probe derivatization and thermal desorption.
Since only volatile molecules and derivatives capable of being thermally
desorbed at 100 °C will interact with the ESI plume, ion suppression
by the urine matrix, observed when diluted urine is directly infused
into an ESI ion source,10 is avoided by
this R-TD ambient ionization approach.

Selectivity in the determination
of creatinine was achieved preionization
by R-TD and postionization by IM and tandem mass spectrometry to reduce
chemical noise. Typical data obtained for the analysis of urine containing
creatinine and creatinine-d3 incorporating
an ion mobility-tandem mass spectrometry separation after mass selection
of the monoacylated ions are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 R-TD-EESI-IM-MS/MS selected ion responses from the analysis of
urine (a) creatinine fragment (m/z 114) and (b) creatinine-d3 fragment
(m/z 117), (c) summed MS data (full
width half height), and (d) IM drift profile for urinary creatinine
(Bin Number 36, Drift Time = 1.6 ms).

The selected ion responses for the protonated creatinine
(m/z 114) and creatinine-d3 (m/z 117)
fragment
ions (Figure 3a,b), from the R-TD-EESI-IM-MS/MS
analysis of the mass-selected monoacylated derivatives, show the effective
fragmentation of the acyl derivatives at m/z 156 and m/z 159. The
mass spectrum obtained by averaging spectra across the width of the
selected ion response (SIR) peak at half height (Figure 3c) shows the protonated creatinine and creatinine-d3 fragment ions. The identification of creatinine
was confirmed by accurate mass measurement of the [M + H]+ ion (m/z 114.0663, mass accuracy
3.5 ppm) using creatinine-d3 as reference
standard. The inset (Figure 3d) shows the mass-selected
ion mobility spectrum for m/z 114
fragment ion. The drift time of an ion is determined by the collision
cross section (i.e., size and shape) of the ion as it passes through
the TWIMS drift cell in the presence of a buffer gas (N2) and under the influence of traveling wave electric field.26,27 The drift profiles for the urinary creatinine and creatinine-d3 have a peak maxima corresponding to a drift
time of 1.62 ms, that matches the drift time obtained from creatinine
standards. The time for the ion mobility separation is short (9 ms)
compared to the creatinine desorption profile time (peak width at
half height ∼3 s) allowing the acquisition of sufficient data
points across the desorption profile. The combination of high resolution
tandem mass spectrometry and ion mobility separation provides selectivity
that supports the use of the direct derivatization and ambient ionization
without prior chromatographic separation for the rapid determination
of urinary creatinine.

The quantitative response for creatinine
standards, spiked with
creatinine-d3 (5 μg/mL), determined
by R-TD-EESI-IM-MS/MS was linear in the range of 2.5–20 μg/mL
(R2 = 0.986) based on the peak area ratios
from six replicate injections for each point in the calibration curve.
This corresponds to endogenous creatinine levels of 0.25–2
mg/mL in urine with the dilution taken into account. The limit of
detection was 0.4 μg/mL (signal/noise, 3:1), and the limit of
quantitation was determined to be 1.35 μg/mL (signal/noise,
10:1).

The potential for the rapid, high throughput determination
of urinary
creatinine was evaluated using replicate aliquots of diluted urine,
mixed with acetic anhydride prior to injection at one minute intervals
and analysis by R-TD-EESI-IM-MS/MS. Figure 4 shows the SIR responses for the urinary creatinine (m/z 114) and creatinine-d3 (m/z 117) fragments ions in the
drift time region of 1.58–1.67 ms, obtained from the analysis.
The thermal desorption process generates sharp desorption profiles
with high intensity and peak widths of ∼3 s. The peaks show
some tailing, but for each injection, the creatinine response returns
to baseline before the next injection, demonstrating that there is
no carry over between samples.

Figure 4 The selected ion responses for (a) urinary
creatinine fragment
(m/z 114) and (b) creatinine-d3 fragment (m/z 117) from six replicate injections of a 1:1 mixture of urine, spiked
with creatinine-d3, and acetic anhydride
using the R-TD-EESI-IM-MS/MS method.

The six urine injections produced responses within the calibrated
range with a mean creatinine concentration in the diluted urine of
14.42 μg/mL. The dilution factor (1:100) gives a urine concentration
of 1.44 mg/mL, which is within the normal urinary creatinine range
based upon the donor (healthy male, 30 years of age). The precision
of the R-TD-EESI-IM-MS/MS technique was determined as 9.9% RSD from
six replicate measurements of urine.

Conclusions
The
determination of urinary creatinine has been performed by a
direct on-probe aqueous acylation prior to thermal desorption and
extractive electrospray-ion mobility-mass spectrometry. The rapid
acylation of creatinine to its monoacyl derivative increases the volatility
of the molecule enabling rapid thermal desorption. The selective determination
of creatinine was achieved preionization by derivatization and thermal
desorption and postionization by ion mobility separation and tandem
mass spectrometry. Quantification was carried out by the use of stable
isotope dilution with creatinine-d3 over
the range of 2.5–20 μg/mL with %RSDs ranging from 8 to
10% for replicate injections. The direct ambient ionization method
allowed high sample throughput, with an injection to injection time
of 1 min. The derivatization-thermal desorption approach is demonstrated
here for the determination of creatinine but could be applied to other
involatile compounds present in complex matrices through the use of
specific derivatizing agents to promote volatility and desorption
of a target molecule, enabling direct quantitation while reducing
background matrix interference.
