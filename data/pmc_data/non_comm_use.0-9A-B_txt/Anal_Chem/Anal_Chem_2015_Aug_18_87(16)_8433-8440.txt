There
has been a renewed appreciation for the dynamic nature of
ribonucleic acid (RNA) modifications and for the impact of modified
RNAs on organism health resulting in an increased emphasis on developing
analytical methods capable of detecting modifications within specific
RNA sequence contexts. Here we demonstrate that a DNA-based exclusion
list enhances data dependent liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) detection of post-transcriptionally modified nucleosides
within specific RNA sequences. This approach is possible because all
post-transcriptional modifications of RNA, except pseudouridine, result
in a mass increase in the canonical nucleoside undergoing chemical
modification. Thus, DNA-based sequences reflect the state of the RNA
prior to or in the absence of modification. The utility of this exclusion
list strategy is demonstrated through the RNA modification mapping
of total tRNAs from the bacteria Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptomyces griseus. Creation of a DNA-based exclusion list is shown to consistently
enhance the number of detected modified ribonuclease (RNase) digestion
products by ∼20%. All modified RNase digestion products that
were detected during standard data dependent acquisition (DDA) LC-MS/MS
were also detected when the DNA-based exclusion list was used. Consequently,
the increase in detected modified RNase digestion products is attributed
to new experimental information only obtained when using the exclusion
list. This exclusion list strategy should be broadly applicable to
any class of RNA and improves the utility of mass spectrometry approaches
for discovery-based analyses of RNA modifications, such as are required
for studies of the epitranscriptome.

==== Body
Transfer
ribonucleic acids (tRNAs)
deliver amino acids to the ribosome for the translation of messenger
ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) into proteins. All tRNAs undergo post-transcriptional
processing and modification,1 and those
modifications have structural and functional significance. Post-transcriptionally
modified nucleotides have a considerable influence on tertiary structure
stabilization,2 the decoding process3 and aminoacyl tRNA synthetase recognition.4 To date, more than 100 different naturally occurring
RNA modifications have been identified from all three domain of life.5

Recently, there has been a renewed appreciation
for the dynamic
nature of RNA modification and for the impact of modified RNAs on
organism health.6−12 Thus, there has been an increased emphasis on developing analytical
methods capable of detecting modifications within specific RNA sequence
contexts. In addition to historical methods for the characterization
of modified RNAs,13−15 approaches based on genomic sequencing technologies,
for example, microarrays or RNA-seq,16−20 provide advantages related to sensitivity, broad
applicability to sample types such as mRNA, and more readily available
informatics tools to assist in processing large amounts of data. One
trade-off is the limited number of modifications that can be characterized
by such approaches.

Another popular approach for characterizing
modified RNAs involves
mass spectrometry.21−23 RNA modification mapping, as developed by McCloskey
and co-workers,24−26 utilizes a base-specific ribonuclease (RNase) to
cleave a larger RNA into smaller digestion products. These digestion
products can be separated and analyzed using liquid chromatography
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Except for pseudouridine (Ψ),
which is the isomer of uridine, all modified nucleotides are detected
at a higher mass than the canonical nucleotide because of the chemical
groups added during modification.27

Unlike genomic-based approaches, mass spectrometry approaches have
more commonly been applied in a serial fashion (i.e., one RNA sequence
at a time) and even in cases where multiplexing has been used (e.g.,
total census of modified nucleosides,28,29 comparative
analysis of RNA digests (CARD)30,31), there are still limitations
on the upper number of RNA sequences that are amenable to LC-MS/MS
analysis. The challenge in the standard RNA modification mapping approach
is seen by simply calculating the expected number of RNase digestion
products from any given group of RNA sequences. For example, a recent
publication demonstrating the mapping of modifications onto the total
tRNA pool from Lactococcus lactis required the analysis
of ∼200 RNase T1 digestion products that were detected during
LC-MS/MS.32 Even then, multiple RNase digestions
were required to obtain complete mapping coverage of the 40 unique
tRNAs from this bacterium.

Because of the wealth of genomic
information on RNAs,33 a unique aspect
of RNA modification mapping
is that complete RNA sequencing by mass spectrometry is not required—one
simply seeks to identify those sequence locations that contain a modification.
Presumably, by limiting MS/MS analysis to only RNase digestion products
that contain one or more modified nucleotides, the information on
modified RNase digestion products should increase thereby facilitating
the parallel analysis of multiple modified RNAs.

One possible
strategy for increasing the sample information generated
during analysis is the use of an exclusion list with data dependent
analysis (DDA) approaches.34 As previously
implemented in proteomics, tryptic peptides that were detected from
the previous run were added to the exclusion list for the following
runs.35 By creating an exclusion list based
on previously identified tryptic peptides, all subsequent analyses
enabled deeper coverage of the sample leading to an overall increase
in protein identifications.

Here we describe a different implementation
of an exclusion list
approach. As genomic information already defines the RNA sequence
of interest and as all post-transcriptional modifications except pseudouridine
will result in a mass increase to the canonical nucleotide being modified,
it follows that the mass of unmodified RNase-generated digestion products
are predictable a priori and can be used to populate an exclusion
list. Post-transcriptionally modified digestion products will appear
at a different (higher) mass value than those predicted by transcribing
the known gene sequences. Theoretically with such an exclusion list,
only modified digestion products will trigger data dependent collision-induced
dissociation (CID) to yield MS/MS spectra. The anticipated advantages
include an improvement in the MS/MS coverage of modified digestion
products, a reduction in the number of MS/MS spectra that must be
interpreted during LC-MS/MS, and the capacity to handle more complex
mixtures of RNAs. As demonstrated here, this exclusion list strategy
does not require knowledge from previous MS/MS analyses nor prior
knowledge of RNA modification status for implementation. This DNA-based
exclusion list strategy provides an unbiased approach for generating
LC-MS/MS data from modified RNAs with deeper sequence coverage than
is obtained by standard DDA methods.

Experimental Section
Material
Streptomyces griseus ATCC
13350 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA). Lactococcus lactisssp. cremoris MG 1363 was a gift from Prof. Bert Poolman. Escherichia
coli total tRNA, lysozyme chloride from chicken egg white,
phenol, chloroform, RNase T1, 1,1,1,3,3,3 hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP)
and TriReagent were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Triethylamine
(TEA) was purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). HPLC
grade methanol and water (Burdick & Jackson Kalamazoo, MI) was
used during chromatography.

Sample Preparation
S. griseus and L. lactis were cultured as described.32,36 Transfer RNAs were isolated using lysozyme buffer and TriReagent,
followed by phenol-chloroform precipitation and ion exchange column
purification.32S. griseus tRNAs were digested to nucleosides using Nuclease P1, snake venom
phosphodiesterase, and Antarctic phosphatase as described.37 For RNA modification mapping, eight micrograms
of purified total tRNAs were added to 400 U of RNase T1 in 4 μL
of 220 mM ammonium acetate buffer. The mixture was incubated at 40
°C for 2 h.

Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry
Analysis
of the S. griseus total tRNA nucleoside digests were
done using a Hitachi D-7000 HPLC equipped with a UV detector. Nucleosides
were separated on a Supelcosil LC-18S column, 5 μm, 2.1 mm ×
250 mm (Supelco), with mobile phase A (MPA) of 5 mM ammonium acetate,
pH 5.3, and mobile phase B (MPB) of 40% aqueous acetonitrile at a
flow rate of 300 μL min–1. The column eluent
was split immediately post column, 1/3 to a Thermo Scientific (Waltham,
MA) LTQ-XL linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an ion
max electrospray source and 2/3 to the UV detector set at 260 nm.

Mass spectra were recorded in the positive ion mode over an m/z range of 105–800 with a capillary
temperature of 275 °C, spray voltage of 4.0 kV and sheath gas,
auxiliary gas and sweep gas of 35, 20, and 20 arbitrary units, respectively.
Data dependent MS/MS of each of the two most abundant ions were recorded
throughout the LC/MS run.

RNase T1 digestion products were separated
on an Xbridge C18 column,
3.5 μm, 1 mm × 150 mm (Waters) with MPA of 400 mM HFIP,
16 mM TEA in water, pH 7 and MPB of 50% MPA and 50% methanol at a
flow rate 30 μL min–1. Digestion products
were eluted using a gradient from 5%B to 99%B in 49 min, followed
by 99% B for 5 min.

RNase T1 digestion products were analyzed
using the Thermo LTQ-XL
linear ion trap mass spectrometer. Electrospray ionization mass spectra
were recorded in negative polarity at a capillary temperature of 275
°C, spray voltage of 3.7 kV, and 35, 14, and 10 arbitrary flow
units of sheath, auxiliary and sweep gas, respectively. Each analysis
segment contains a full scan from m/z 650 to 1800 (scan event 1) followed by four data-dependent scans
triggered by the four most abundant precursors from scan event 1 (scan
events 2–5). The maximum injection period for MS/MS was fixed
at 250 ms with an intensity threshold of 500 counts. Samples were
analyzed with the same MS/MS parameters for both standard DDA and
exclusion list methods. During analysis using an exclusion list, the
LC-MS/MS run was divided into six time segments with excluded m/z values added to the appropriate segment
based on the elution time of the RNase T1 digestion product. Each
ion selected for CID was analyzed for up to 8 scans before it was
added to a dynamic exclusion list for 45 s for both data dependent
approaches.

Data Analysis
All instrument control
and data processing
steps were performed with Xcaliber software. The tRNA genomic sequences
were obtained from the Genomic tRNA Database (http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/).33E. coli tRNA sequences
with post-transcriptional modifications were obtained from Modomics
(http://modomics.genesilico.pl/).5 Two approaches were used to analyze the LC-MS/MS data. Manual annotation
of MS/MS spectra was performed by calculating expected m/z values of all RNase T1 digestion products based
on either genomic tRNA sequences or the known post-transcriptionally
modified E. coli tRNA sequences using the MongoOligo
calculator (http://mods.rna.albany.edu/masspec/Mongo-Oligo). Automated annotation was conducted using RoboOligo38 and in-house software. The criterion for detection
of a particular RNase T1 digestion product based on MS/MS analysis
was at least 80% of the expected c- and y-type ions were found during
spectral annotation,32 except for 7-methylguanosine
containing digestion products, which fragment uniquely.39

Results and Discussion
In the standard
DDA-based LC-MS/MS RNA modification mapping approach,
all precursors with an ion abundance above the user-defined threshold
are candidates for CID analysis. However, as the goal of RNA modification
mapping experiments is to place modified nucleosides in the correct
RNA sequence context, RNase digestion products that do not contain
a modified nucleoside can be considered to be information-deficient
oligonucleotides. Moreover, as unmodified oligonucleotides are typically
much more abundant than digestion products containing modifications,24 the standard DDA approach can be inefficient
for detecting modified digestion products unless a large number of
DDA scans are available during analysis. To overcome these limitations,
the use of DNA-based exclusion lists was investigated. These static
exclusion lists are generated based on the known sequences of the
RNAs being analyzed.

Exclusion List Generation
It has
been shown that standard
DDA creates sampling bias against low abundance precursor ions relative
to other sample components.35 To determine
whether an exclusion list strategy would increase the information
obtained during LC-MS/MS analysis of modified oligonucleotides, this
strategy was first evaluated using E. coli total
tRNAs. The modification status of these tRNAs is well characterized
through a number of independent analyses.5 Moreover, E. coli total tRNA has been used previously
in developing new analytical mass spectrometry approaches for RNA
modification mapping of complex mixtures.30,31,40,41 Using the
existing annotated E. coli tRNA sequences,5,42 a total of 73 unique RNase T1 digestion products containing at least
one post-transcriptionally modified nucleoside (excluding pseudouridine)
are expected.

To create the exclusion list, the genomic tRNA
(tDNA) sequences for E. coli were in silico digested with RNase T1 to generate a catalog of all possible unmodified
digestion products. The appropriate m/z values including multiply charged ions for each unmodified digestion
product were then determined. For E. coli, the 47
unique tDNA sequences yielded 215 predicted RNase T1 digestion products.
Reducing these digestion products to those of unique mass resulted
in 122 digestion products, leading finally to 191 unique m/z values to populate the exclusion list.

To minimize exclusion list interferences initially observed during
an HPLC elution time-independent exclusion strategy (data not shown),
these m/z values were separated
into five groups based on the known elution times of the digestion
products. These time periods (1–30, 30–35, 35–40,
40–45, and 45–50 min) were determined empirically to
best minimize overlap and match the known length-dependence of oligonucleotide
separations seen when using ion pairing reversed phase HPLC.43

During initial studies on this exclusion
list approach, it was
discovered that sodium adducts could trigger data dependent CID (data
not shown). In addition to the predicted molecular ions for each RNase
T1 digestion product, the mass of a sodium atom was added to each
of the unique m/z values calculated
above to minimize DDA of such adducts. While potassium adducts were
also found to interfere in select instances, the potential overlaps
between unmodified digestion products with potassium and modified
sequences were determined to be significant enough to warrant not
adding potassium adducts to the exclusion list. Thus, starting with
tDNA sequences, a final time-dependent exclusion list for molecular
ions (multiply charged when oligomer length ≥4) and sodium
adducts was used for the RNA modification mapping of E. coli and all other bacteria investigated here.

Exclusion List DDA Approach
for Total tRNA Modification Mapping
After finalizing the
approach for creating an exclusion list, RNase
T1 digestion products from E. coli total tRNA were
analyzed. A representative example of the gains available by an exclusion
list approach is illustrated in Figure 1. More than 20 m/z values are seen in the mass spectrum associated with an LC elution
period from 38.83–39.04 min. During standard DDA, the least
abundant m/z value that triggered
CID was m/z 967.17. In contrast,
using the E. coli tDNA sequences to construct an
exclusion list resulted in an improvement in the dynamic range of
the MS/MS analysis, with the least abundant m/z value that now triggered CID being m/z 1079.17. This dynamic range improvement resulted in the
detection and MS/MS analysis of three post-transcriptionally modified
digestion products: AA[s4U]AG (m/z 835.17 Figure 2A), [m1G]UUCUG (m/z 971.67 Figure 2B),
and U[Um]U[cmnm5s2U]UG (m/z 1004.08 Figure 2C). Significantly, even multiple replicate analyses during
standard DDA failed to trigger MS/MS of these three modified oligonucleotides.

Figure 1 Mass spectrum
arising from the LC-MS/MS analysis of RNase T1 digestion
of E. coli total tRNAs. The mass spectral data corresponds
to ions eluting from 38.83–39.04 min. As noted, the dynamic
range for data dependent MS/MS increases when a tDNA-based exclusion
list is implemented.

Given the potential improvements seen by increasing the dynamic
range for MS/MS analysis of RNase digestion products containing post-transcriptionally
modified nucleosides, the next goal was to determine the effectiveness
of this strategy for RNA modification mapping across the entire total
tRNA sample. A standard DDA-based LC-MS/MS analysis of RNase T1 digestion
products from E. coli total tRNAs resulted in the
detection of 50–51 digestion products across three replicate
analyses (Table 1).
Of the total, 49 digestion products were detected consistently in
all three analyses. When the exclusion list approach was used, an
additional 8–10 expected digestion products were detected (Table 1). During these replicate
exclusion list analyses, 59 digestion products were detected consistently.
Thus, the use of an exclusion list increased the number of detected
modified digestion products by ∼20%. Importantly, the use of
an exclusion list retained detection of all modified RNase T1 digestion
products detected by standard DDA, thus the 20% improvement can be
attributed to previously undetected digestion products.

LC-MS/MS Using an Exclusion List

% increase	16%	20%	18%	
Despite
this 20% increase, 13 predicted digestion products were
not detected even using the exclusion list approach. To understand
why, these digestion products were examined in greater detail (Table 2). It was found that
six predicted digestion products were not detected at the MS stage.
For half of those not detected (DDAUG, UU[cmo5U]G and ACU[cmo5U]G), an m/z signal and
corresponding MS/MS data for a hyper- or hypomodified variant were
detected during both standard DDA and exclusion list analysis. Detection
of these variants suggests a difference exists in the modification
states of these tRNAs for the sample analyzed as compared to those
already catalogued in the modified tRNA databases.5,42 Importantly,
their absence was not attributed to any deficiency in the exclusion
list strategy.

using an enhanced exclusion
list (see text for details).

The other three predicted digestion products not detected at the
MS stage (CCCCUCCU[t6A]AG, ACU[k2C]AU[t6A]A[Ψ]CG, and AC[s2C]U[mnm5U]CU[t6A]AG) were not found in a hyper- or hypomodified variant.
Their absence could be attributed to an absence of the predicted tRNA
in the analyzed sample, to the tRNA being present at levels below
the limits of detection of the LC-MS system used, or to low ionization
efficiency of the particular RNase T1 digestion product. To determine
whether the expected tRNA was present in the sample, other signature
digestion products40 associated with these
three tRNAs (tRNA-Arg (CCU), tRNA-Ile (CAU) and tRNA-Arg (UCU)) were
searched for within the LC-MS/MS data set. Low abundance unmodified
signature digestion products for tRNA-Arg (CCU) and tRNA-Arg (UCU)
were found within the exclusion list data set (MS only) supporting
the explanation that these tRNAs are present but at amounts approaching
the limit of detection by our LC-MS/MS system. In contrast, two high
abundance signature digestion products for tRNA-Ile (CAU) were detected.
As these signature digestion products are modified, they also generated
MS/MS data during the exclusion list analysis. Detection of these
modified signature digestion products suggests that the undetected
modified digestion product for tRNA-Ile (CAU), ACU[k2C]AU[t6A]AUCG, has an ionization efficiency much lower than those
of other coeluting digestion products thereby limiting detection of
this expected product.

The identification of three of the remaining
undetected E. coli total tRNA RNase T1 digestion
products was hindered
by interferences with very similar digestion products. For example,
the coeluting digestion products CCCUU[s4U]AG and CCCCU[s4U]AG diverge by 1 Da because of a C to U difference in the
two sequences. Other coeluting digestion products of closely related
sequence and mass include AADC[Gm]G/AADD[Gm]G and AAADC[Gm]G/AAADD[Gm]G.
While the mass difference for both pairs is 3 Da (C → D), the
resulting MS/MS spectra cannot readily differentiate components of
dissimilar ion abundance. In these cases, only the higher abundance
digestion product was considered to be identified and included in
the calculated values shown in Table 1.

Finally, four predicted modified digestion
products were found
to be present within the MS data but did not trigger data dependent
CID for MS/MS with either approach. Thus, these four digestion products
were available for detection but were missed even during the exclusion
list approach due to a limited number of data dependent events per
analysis segment. A representative example is seen in Figure 3. Improvements in chromatography
or an increase in the number of data dependent events might address
the MS/MS detection of such low abundance digestion products.

Figure 3 Mass spectrum
arising from the LC-MS/MS analysis of RNase T1 digestion
of E. coli total tRNAs. The mass spectral data corresponds
to ions eluting from 39.70–39.81 min. In this instance, even
the implementation of the tDNA-based exclusion list does not enable
detection of two low abundance modified RNase T1 digestion products.
Modified nucleosides: acp3U: 3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)uridine;
others defined in Table 4.

Alternatively, as was done in
a proteomics implementation of the
exclusion list strategy,35 one could analyze
the same sample a second time wherein the original exclusion list
is enhanced with the m/z values
of modified digestion products detected in the initial LC-MS/MS analysis.
Such an approach was also tested here by creating an enhanced exclusion
list containing all unmodified digestion products plus m/z values of modified digestion products detected
by the exclusion list approach. When this enhanced static exclusion
list was created and applied to the analysis of E. coli tRNAs, three of the four predicted modified digestion products that
were present in the MS data but did not initially trigger MS/MS could
now be detected in the MS/MS data. Only CC[s2C]UCCG from
tRNA-Arg(CCG) failed to trigger data dependent CID when using the
enhanced exclusion list.

Exclusion List Improvements in Total tRNA
Modification Mapping
An added benefit of using the exclusion
list strategy on this well-characterized
sample was the detection of four previously unidentified RNase T1
digestion products with modifications. The four modified oligonucleotides
are (6)AA[s4U]AG(10) from tRNA-Gly (GCC), (31)AUU[cmo5U]AG(36) from tRNA-Leu (UAG), (36)U[t6A]AUCAG(42)
from tRNA-Thr (UGU) and (2)UCCCCU[s4U]CG(10) from tRNA-Glu
(UUC). All four post-transcriptionally modified oligonucleotides were
detected solely during the exclusion list approach and were detected
reproducibly in each of the three replicate analyses. As these four
modified digestion products were previously unreported, they are not
included in the calculated values within Table 1.

To determine whether these previously
unreported sites of modification arise within a hypomodified context,
the unmodified versions of each digestion product were sought within
the data. The only hypomodified RNase T1 digestion product found corresponded
to (2)UCCCCUUCG(10) from tRNA-Glu (UUC). This digestion product was
detected at high abundance with the modified counterpart present at
<15% of the unmodified variant (Figure 4), consistent with hypomodification of 4-thiouridine
at position 8 within this tRNA.

Figure 4 Mass spectrum arising from the LC-MS/MS
analysis of RNase T1 digestion
of E. coli total tRNAs. The mass spectral data corresponds
to ions eluting from 42.27–42.57 min. Both an unmodified (m/z 1402.58) and hypomodified (m/z 1410.08) RNase T1 digestion product
from E. coli tRNA-Thr (UGU) can be identified in
this spectrum.

Taken together, these
data demonstrate that the use of a tDNA-based
exclusion list for tRNA modification mapping is significantly more
effective than the standard DDA approach. Of the 73 predicted modified
RNase T1 digestion products from E. coli, only three
previously known digestion products present in the sample could not
be detected by the strategy implemented here. Moreover, the dynamic
range improvements achieved during MS/MS enabled the detection of
four previously unknown modified digestion products. As implementation
of an exclusion list does not compromise the data attainable by the
standard DDA approach, this strategy should prove to be useful for
characterizing complex mixtures of modified oligonucleotides.

Lactococcus lactis Total tRNAs
Buoyed
by the improvements in RNA modification mapping using an exclusion
list strategy with the known tRNAs from E. coli,
the same strategy was then applied to L. lactis total
tRNAs. Recently we reported initial results on the tRNA modification
profiles for L. lactis, which were obtained using
multiple RNases and a standard DDA-based LC-MS/MS strategy.32 From those initial results, a total of 58 unique
RNase T1 digestion products containing at least one post-transcriptionally
modified nucleoside (pseudouridine excepted) are expected.

As
noted in Table 3, 47–48
modified digestion products were identified using the exclusion list,
which was nearly a 20% improvement over the standard DDA approach.
As with the E. coli analyses, all of the digestion
products detected by standard DDA were again detected when using the
exclusion list strategy. However, a significant fraction (20/58 =
34%) of the predicted RNase T1 digestion products32 were not found in the exclusion list MS/MS data. A closer
examination of the data revealed the low coverage of expected modified
digestion products can be explained by three factors: (1) no MS signal
was detected for the predicted modified digestion product; (2) coelution
of closely related modified sequences that cannot be unambiguously
identified based on MS/MS results; and (3) previously unreported modifications
yield new (unpredicted) digestion products. Updating the L.
lactis tRNA sequences with modifications detected in this
work and recomputing the expected digestion products and their detection
reduces the number of undetected yet predicted digestion products
to 20%. This value is more consistent with that seen during the E. coli analyses, where 13 of the 73 predicted digestion
products were not detected in the exclusion list MS/MS data.

Streptomyces griseus Total tRNA
While E.
coli total tRNAs were used to develop this exclusion
list strategy and L. lactis total tRNAs served as
a previously evaluated data set to confirm the general characteristics
of this approach, a more fruitful application would be for RNA modification
mapping of bacteria that are presently uncharacterized. Thus, total
tRNAs from S. griseus, a Gram-positive bacterium
with high GC content, were chosen. The modified nucleosides in S. griseus and their placement on S. griseus tRNA sequences have not been reported previously, thus this organism
should be a reasonable test of this exclusion list approach. To facilitate
characterization of the RNase T1 digestion products, first a census
of modifications was obtained from the LC-MS/MS analysis of a nucleoside
digest.24 Seventeen unique modified nucleosides
were identified from S. griseus tRNAs (Table 4). In comparison to Bacillus subtilis, another
Gram-positive firmicute, S. griseus was found to
lack mo5U, cmnm5U, cmnm5s2U, k2C, Q, m5U, and s4U. The first
five of these modifications are located at position 34 of anticodon
loop.5 The absence of m5U (rT)
was intriguing, as this modification is typically present as part
of the conserved TΨC loop in tRNAs.5 4-Thiouridine (s4U) is commonly found at position 8 of
tRNAs.5 Overall, S. griseus tRNAs appear to be less extensively modified than other bacterial
tRNAs. Thus, the expectation is that fewer modified RNase T1 digestion
products will be present.

As before, the RNase T1 digestion
products from S. griseus total tRNA were analyzed
using both the standard DDA and exclusion
list approaches (Table 5). Compared to the information obtained during a standard DDA analysis,
the exclusion list approach yielded 18% more post-transcriptionally
modified digestion products. As before, all modified digestion products
detected by standard DDA were also seen in the exclusion list data
set, thus the increase in detected modified digestion products is
new information from the experimental analysis. These data confirm
the gains achieved by an exclusion list strategy are consistent regardless
of the bacterium studied with ∼20% more digestion products
being identified by MS/MS with the exclusion list. While a significant
number of the modified digestion products can be mapped back onto
a unique genomic tRNA sequence, complete modification mapping and
unambiguous sequence assignment requires complementary data from additional
RNase digestions.32

Data Analysis
The previous results demonstrate that
use of a tDNA-based exclusion list leads to a valuable increase in
the number of modified digestion products detected by LC-MS/MS when
analyzing total tRNAs from bacteria. Although it was initially assumed
that the exclusion list would reduce the number of MS/MS spectra that
must be interpreted for RNA modification mapping, experimentally it
was found that there were minimal differences in the number of MS/MS
spectra generated in each case. During standard DDA, 6766 MS/MS scan
events from L. lactis and 8290 MS/MS scan events
from S. griseus, on average, were generated. Use
of the exclusion list approach found that 5753 MS/MS scan events from L. lactis and 7910 MS/MS scan events from S. griseus, on average, were generated.

While the number of MS/MS scan
events was similar in both approaches, a significant difference was
found when these spectra were annotated. On average, 143 and 162 RNase
T1 digestion products from L. lactis and S. griseus, respectively, could be annotated from the MS/MS
data generated by the standard DDA approach. Those numbers decrease
to 65 annotated digestion products from L. lactis and 82 annotated digestion products from S. griseus, on average, during the exclusion list analyses. This reduction
in the number of annotated MS/MS spectra arises as a significant fraction
of the MS/MS scans during exclusion list analysis were from low abundance m/z values not associated with tRNA digestion
products. Thus, with the exceptions already noted earlier, the exclusion
list strategy enables a thorough analysis of all m/z values that arise from sample-related oligonucleotides.
Although not investigated here, it is anticipated that a higher DDA
threshold would reduce the number of MS/MS scan events further when
the exclusion list strategy is implemented.

One limitation of
an RNA modification mapping approach that uses
LC-MS/MS is the inability to assign specific modified nucleoside identities
in the MS/MS spectrum, where isomeric modifications could exist. For
example, modified RNase T1 digestion products found to contain a methylated
guanosine in the S. griseus data could arise from
four possibilities: m1G, m2G, m7G,
or Gm (Table 4). While
one can take advantage of unique MS/MS fragmentation for some modifications,
such as m7G,39 in general one
must rely upon known homology in tRNA modification sites or conduct
more detailed sample fractionation and analysis.32 It is anticipated that the deeper coverage in modification
mapping data that is facilitated by this exclusion list approach may
increase the likelihood that such isomeric possibilities are encountered.

Conclusions
Extending RNA modification mapping studies into
mixtures of RNAs
is challenging because of the more abundant population of unmodified
digestion products in the sample. By creating an exclusion list built
from the known DNA sequences of the RNA samples of interest, MS/MS
cycles can be focused on digestion products containing one or more
modified nucleosides. This approach provides deeper LC-MS/MS coverage
of modified digestion products present in the sample enabling detection
of previously unreported sequence locations of modified nucleosides.
While only illustrated using complex RNase T1 digestion products from
bacterial total tRNA samples, the approach should be applicable to
other RNases and other RNA classes. Moreover, this concept should
also facilitate sequence-based placement of DNA lesions, which also
result in a mass change of the oligonucleotide and occur at relatively
low levels within the sample, as well as the characterization of low-level
impurities within synthetic oligonucleotide samples.44

While this exclusion list strategy enhances the information
that
can be obtained during sample analysis, complete and unambiguous RNA
modification mapping still requires the use of multiple RNases to
provide appropriate sequence coverage.32 Moreover, multiple RNases are required as closely related coeluting
modified digestion products can be challenging to identify even when
using this exclusion list strategy. To minimize such effects, a time-dependent
exclusion list was used in this work, although improved chromatographic
methods are an alternative that could also be explored.

Although
species-specific exclusion lists were generated in this
work to demonstrate proof-of-concept, this approach should be readily
extendable to a universal exclusion list that would exclude any possible
particular RNase digestion product combination of base compositions.
Such a universal exclusion list would facilitate application of RNA
modification mapping into samples that are composed of more than one
type of RNA or that arise from more than one organism, such as samples
isolated from the microbiome. Moreover, a universal exclusion list
approach should improve the capabilities of LC-MS/MS for the discovery-based
characterization of dynamic changes in RNA modification status allowing
this technique to be used in large-scale studies of the epitranscriptome.
