An
understanding of potassium chemistry in energy conversion processes
supports the development of complex biomass utilization with high
efficiency and low pollutant emissions. Potassium exists mainly as
potassium hydroxide (KOH), potassium chloride (KCl), and atomic potassium
(K) in combustion and related thermochemical processes. We report,
for the first time, the measurement of the ultraviolet (UV) absorption
cross sections of KOH and KCl at temperatures between 1300 K and 1800
K, using a newly developed method. Using the spectrally resolved UV
absorption cross sections, the concentrations of KOH and KCl were
measured simultaneously. In addition, we measured the concentrations
of atomic K using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy, both
at 404.4 and 769.9 nm. The 404.4 nm line was utilized to expand the
measurement dynamic range to higher concentrations. A constant amount
of KCl was seeded into premixed CH4/air flames with equivalence
ratios varied from 0.67 to 1.32, and the concentrations of KOH, KCl,
and atomic K in the hot flue gas were measured nonintrusively. The
results indicate that these techniques can provide comprehensive data
for quantitative understanding of the potassium chemistry in biomass
combustion/gasification.

==== Body
Biomass fuels, especially herbaceous,
usually have a high content of potassium, which will be released as
potassium hydroxide (KOH), potassium chloride (KCl), and atomic potassium
(K) during combustion and gasification.1−3 These potassium species,
especially KCl, can cause severe operation problems of combustors
and gasifiers, such as slagging, fouling, and high-temperature corrosion.4 Thus, knowledge and understanding of the formation
and release of potassium species is desired.

Optical diagnostics
have been widely employed for concentration
measurements of potassium species in many related studies.5−8 Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was adopted to measure
the total amount of potassium in flames,9,10 while excimer
laser-induced fragmentation fluorescence (ELIF) was used to detect
the total amount of KOH and KCl compounds.11,12 Planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) has been used in measuring
K atoms released from a burning biomass pellet.8 To obtain reliable quantitative results, the application
of absorption spectroscopic techniques is essential. Broadband UV
absorption spectroscopy is a powerful tool for measurement of KCl
and KOH,13−15 and tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS)
has been applied to measure K atoms.7,16 Collinear
photofragmentation and atomic absorption spectroscopy (CPFAAS) was
developed by Sorvajärvi et al.17 for simultaneous detection of KCl, KOH, and atomic K.

In both
UV absorption spectroscopy and the CPFAAS technique, absolute
values of the UV absorption cross-section of KOH and KCl are indispensable
in obtaining absolute concentrations. The UV absorption cross sections
of KCl have been determined in previous investigations,18−20 but these values are only available for temperatures up to 1200
K. The UV absorption cross sections of KOH and KCl at elevated temperatures,
valid in combustion environments, are still lacking. Rowland and Makide21 estimated the absorption cross sections of NaOH
in flames based on the measurement of Daidoji,22 but the values relied on the calculated amount of NaOH
seeded into the flame, which introduced a severe uncertainty. Recently,
Weng et al.23 measured the UV absorption
spectrum of KOH and KCl in flame environments, and the UV absorption
cross sections were evaluated based on the KCl absorption data presented
by Leffler et al.,20 which were obtained
at 1073 K. In the study of Weng et al.,23 the influence of even higher temperature on the absorption cross-section
values was assumed to be negligible.

In the present work, a
new method is developed to directly evaluate
the UV absorption cross sections of KOH and KCl in environments with
temperatures of ∼1300 and 1800 K. Using the obtained cross
sections, quantitative measurements of potassium species were made
in flames seeded with a constant amount of KCl, but with equivalence
ratios varied from 0.67 to 1.32 and a post-flame temperature of ∼1800
K. Comprehensive experimental data were obtained as a substantial
improvement in the study of the potassium chemistry, compared to the
previous research based on the measurement of K atoms25,26 or the total amount of KCl and KOH.15 The concentration variation with equivalence ratios is discussed.
The chemical balance between potassium species in different flame
environments is presented.

Methodology
Burner and Flame Conditions
Homogenous hot flue gas
environments in a series of well-defined conditions are prepared using
an in-house developed multijet burner,27 which has a rectangular outlet 85 mm × 47 mm in size. As shown
in Figure 1, the burner
consists of two chambers, namely, the jet chamber and the coflow chamber.
The jet chamber supplies premixed gases to 181 cone-shaped laminar
flames stabilized on an array of jet nozzles, and the coflow chamber
supplies coflow gases through a perforated plate with holes surrounding
each premixed jet flame evenly. The temperature and composition of
the mimicked hot flue gas can be controlled by adjusting the composition
and flow rates of the inlet gases, which are controlled via well-calibrated
mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst). The flame conditions used in this
study are presented in Table 1.

Figure 1 Schematic of (a) the setup for the burner system, and (b) the TDLAS
system and the UV absorption system with the burner (top view).

The investigated flames
have different global equivalence ratios
and temperatures (cf. Table 1). The global equivalence ratio (ϕ) is calculated based
on the composition of the total inlet gases, indicating whether the
environment of the hot flue gas is oxidative (ϕ < 1.0) or
reductive (ϕ > 1.0). The temperature of the hot flue gas
was
measured using two-line atomic fluorescence thermometry (TLAF), which
will be described in the following section.

Water solutions
with 0.5 mol/L of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) or 1.0 mol/L of KCl were prepared and seeded into
the flames. A fog of the solution, generated by an ultrasonic generator,
was transported by an air flow with a flow rate of 0.41 sL/min into
the jet chamber and thus seeded into the premixed jet flames, together
with the reactant gases. The K2CO3 or KCl in
the fog was vaporized and decomposed as it passed through the flame
front region, and gas-phase potassium species, mainly KOH, KCl, and
atomic K, were formed in the hot flue gases. Chloroform (CHCl3) was used as another source of chlorine in the hot flue gas,
besides potassium chloride, to control the ratio between potassium
and chlorine. Liquid chloroform was filled in a gas bubbler bottle
stored in a temperature bath (PolyScience) regulated at 273 K. The
chloroform vapor was transported by a nitrogen flow into the jet chamber
with a known concentration (a vapor pressure of 0.0779 bar at 273
K).28 Assuming that all chloroform was
decomposed through the flame fronts,29,30 the concentration
of chlorine in the hot flue gas was calculated, and the value was
controlled by adjusting the flow rate of the carrier gas.

Temperature
Measurements
The temperature of the hot
flue gas ∼5 mm above the burner outlet was measured with the
TLAF technique, and the results are presented in Table 1 with an uncertainty of ∼3%.31 The details of the TLAF technique using In atoms
have been described by Borggren et al.31,32 The present
study used a similar setup, which mainly consisted of three parts,
i.e., the indium seeding system, the laser system, and the imaging
system. For indium seeding, an indium chloride (InCl3)
solution was used in the same system employed for potassium seeding.
After passage through the flame front, free In atoms were produced
to be used as the temperature marker. The laser system consists of
two external cavity diode lasers (Toptica, Models DL100pro and DL
100) controlled by two separate analog control units, each including
a temperature control module (DTC 110) and a current control module
(DCC 110). Two continuous-wave laser beams were produced at wavelengths
410 and 451 nm. Both lasers have a power of ∼5 mW and a beam
size of ∼1 mm2. The laser beams were overlapped
using a dichroic mirror and passed through the hot flue gas at a height
of ∼5 mm above the burner outlet. The indium transitions, 52P1/2 → 62S1/2 and 52P3/2 → 62S1/2, were probed and the fluorescence at 451 nm was captured by an ICCD
camera (Princeton Instruments, Model PI-MAX 3) through a band-pass
filter (450 nm ±10 nm). Evaluating the fluorescence signal, a
temperature profile above the burner outlet was obtained.

Concentration
of Potassium Atoms
The concentration
of K atoms was measured using the TDLAS system, based on the Beer–Lambert
law:7,16,33,34 1  where ν is the frequency of the light, I0(ν) and I(ν) are
the intensity of the light before and after passing through the absorbers,
respectively, and In and Ie are the frequency-independent
backgrounds from the detector dark current and broadband emission,
respectively. It was found that the broadband emission Ie from the investigated methane flames
was negligible, especially as our detector was placed ∼1.5
m away from the flame and an aperture was used in the beam path. In was assumed to be constant
and obtained under the condition without laser beam in the flame.
The frequency-dependent absorbance, α(ν), is proportional
to the optical path length L and the number density N of K atoms:7,35 2  where σ(ν) is the absorption cross
section at frequency ν, which can be expressed as 3  where h is the Planck’s
constant, ν0 the central frequency, B12 the Einstein absorption coefficient, c the speed of light, χ(ν,N,T) the area-normalized line shape function, and T the temperature. The line shape function can be described by a Voigt
profile in the atmospheric environment. The Einstein absorption coefficient B12 can be related to the Einstein spontaneous
emission coefficient A21 and expressed
as 4   5  where g1 and g2 represent the degeneracy of states 1 and 2,
respectively.

In the calculation of the number density of K
atoms, first, the measured absorbance αm(ν)
was obtained based on eq 1 using measured intensities. Then, according to eqs 2 and 3, a Voigt profile
was used to fit the measured absorbance αm(ν).
With the fitted absorbance αf(ν), the number
density N can be derived by integrating over eq 2, and can be expressed
as 6  In the present study, the concentration of
K atoms was measured using two TDLAS systems with tunable continuous-wave
diode lasers centered at 769.9 and 404.4 nm. The schematic diagram
of the TDLAS system is presented in Figure 1b.

In previous studies of potassium,7,16,33,34 TDLAS with 769.9 nm
lasers has been adopted in favor of its high sensitivity. In our 769.9
nm TDLAS system, the beam with a power of ∼3 mW and a size
of ∼1 mm2 was provided by an external cavity laser
(Toptica, Model DL100). Similar to the TLAF system, an analog control
unit was used to control the temperature and the current of the laser.
In addition, a scan control module (SC 110) was used to scan the wavelength
with a range over 35 GHz at a repetition rate of 100 Hz. The scanning
range was monitored by a high-finesse confocal Fabry–Perot
etalon (Topoca, Model FPI 100), and the intensity of the light was
monitored by two photodiodes of the same model (Thorlabs, Model PDA100A).
The laser beam passed through the hot gas at a height of ∼5
mm above the burner outlet with a path length of 8.5 cm.

Typical
scanning signals with and without K atoms are shown in
the insets of Figure 2. They were used to derive the measured absorbance αm(ν) presented in the main graphs. For the measurement with
low concentration of K atoms (Figure 2a), the fitted absorbance αf(ν)
was obtained through the fitting of αm(ν),
using a Voigt profile, which has a full width at half-maximum (fwhm)
of 5.34 GHz, similar to values obtained by Qu et al.16 and Schlosser et al.33 The number
density N was calculated based on eq 6, and the concentration was determined
to be 0.05 ppm.

Figure 2 Absorption curves and Voigt function fittings of the 42S1/2 → 42P1/2 potassium
atom transition at 769.9 nm for concentrations of (a) 0.05 ppm and
(b) 0.52 ppm. The measured curve in panel (b) is truncated due to
strong absorption under optically thick conditions. The insets show
the scanning signal as a function of laser frequency with and without
potassium absorption.

However, as the concentration increases, an absorption spectrum
with regions of complete signal extinction appears, indicating optically
thick conditions, as shown in the inset of Figure 2b. Correspondingly, the absorbance peak was
truncated and reached a maximum plateau level, which cannot be fitted
by a Voigt profile. However, Qu et al.16 reported that the Beer–Lambert law could still be applied
to this condition, and the concentration of K atoms could be determined
through a reconstruction of the absorption profile by fitting to the
wings of the line profile. In the work of Qu et al.,16 a corrected absorbance was used to fit the measured absorbance
αm(ν) under optically thick conditions. In
their correction, a simulated light intensity after absorption, If(ν), was derived based on eq 1, using a simulated absorbance αf(ν) with a Voigt profile from eq 2 and the light intensity without absorption I0(ν). Then, under optically thick conditions,
considering the response limit of the detector, values of If(ν) smaller than In were set to In, through which If(ν)
was corrected to Ifc(ν), which was
used to mimic the actual signal obtained from the detector. This correction
process can be illustrated by the detector response curve shown in Figure 3 with a red dotted
line. Then, the absorbance under optically thick conditions, αfc(ν), was derived from Ifc(ν) and I0(ν), which was
fitted to the measured absorbance αm(ν) through
adjusting the absorbance αf(ν). In the present
study, a similar correction process was used. However, a new correction
equation was adopted for the conversion of If(ν) to Ifc(ν), to
consider the nonlinear response of the detector to the very weak signal.
The proposed nonlinear correction trend is shown in Figure 3, and the equation is expressed
as 7  where β is a constant to fix the curvature
of the correction curve. As shown in Figure 2b, the αfc(ν) was
well fitted to the measured absorbance αm(ν)
with a suitable αf(ν) which was used to calculate
the number density of K atoms using eq 6. The concentration of the K atoms in Figure 2b was determined to be 0.52
ppm.

Figure 3 Proposed correction curve of the detector response used for TDLAS
data analysis.

It is clear that by using
the method described by Qu et al.16 for
optical thick conditions, the measurement
dynamic range can be increased dramatically, i.e., from 40 ppt to
40 ppm for a 1 cm path length for the 769.9 nm potassium 42S1/2 → 42P1/2 line.16 However, in the present study, the path length
is 8.5 cm, and the concentration of K atoms can be over 20 ppm, which
thus made it impossible to achieve a proper measurement using the
769.9 nm line, as most of the measured absorption peak would be truncated.
Therefore, another TDLAS system probing the 404.4 nm 42S1/2 → 52P3/2 transition
was introduced. The 404.4 nm absorption has an Einstein spontaneous
emission coefficient (1.16 × 106 s–1)36 that is much smaller than the 769.9 nm line (3.75
× 107 s–1),36 which allows measurements of much higher concentrations (cf. eqs 2 and 3).

For the 404.4 nm TDLAS system, a beam with a power of ∼5.5
mW and a size of ∼1 mm2 was provided by another
external cavity laser (Toptica, Model DL100pro) controlled by an analog
control unit. The wavelength was scanned with a range of ∼21
GHz with a repetition rate of 100 Hz.

The scanning signals of
the transmitted light with and without
absorption by K atoms are presented in the insets of Figure 4, which were used to derive
the measured absorbance profiles. It can be seen that the scanning
range of 21 GHz cannot cover the entire absorption peak. For a low
concentration situation, similar to the calculation process for the
769.9 nm case, the measured absorbance αm(ν)
was fitted by the absorbance αf(ν), using a
Voigt profile. The absorbance profile shown in Figure 4a has a full width at half-maximum (fwhm)
of 13.3 GHz. In order to check the entire absorption profile, measurements
with different fixed laser wavelengths were conducted, and the absorption
values showed good overlap with the fitting curve from the data measured
using laser scanning. Hence, the fitted absorbance αf(ν) were used in the concentration evaluation with eq 6. The concentration of
K atoms in Figure 4a was determined to be 0.25 ppm, using this approach.

Figure 4 Absorption curves and
the Voigt function fitting of the 42S1/2 →
52P3/2 potassium
atom transition at 404.4 nm for concentrations of (a) 0.25 ppm and
(b) 19.6 ppm. The measured curve in panel (b) is truncated due to
strong absorption under optically thick conditions. The insets show
the scanning signal as the function of laser frequency with and without
potassium absorption.

As the concentration of K atoms increased, the optical thick
conditions
occurred, as shown in the inset of Figure 4b. The corresponding measured absorbance
αm(ν) with truncation of the absorption peak
is shown in Figure 4b, and was well fitted by the absorbance after the correction on
αf(ν) considering the optically thick absorption
feature. Using the obtained αf(ν), the concentration
of the K atoms in Figure 4b was determined to be 19.6 ppm. The introduction of the 404.4
nm TDLAS system thus further expanded our measurement dynamic range
of K atoms, which fulfilled the requirement in this study.

Concentration
of KOH and KCl
The concentrations of
KOH and KCl were measured using UV absorption spectroscopy with the
optical setup presented in Figure 1b. A deuterium lamp was used as the broadband UV light
source and the light was collimated by a parabolic mirror to form
a beam 10 mm in diameter through an aperture, and then guided to the
hot flue gas region. With five UV-enhanced aluminum mirrors, the absorption
path length above the burner was increased to 522 mm. Finally, the
UV light is collected to a spectrometer (USB 2000+, Ocean Optics).
To determine the path length and check the homogeneity over the line
of sight, the distribution of KOH in the flue gas was visualized by
laser-induced photofragmentation fluorescence, using the fifth harmonic
of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser (Brilliant B, Quantel) at a wavelength of
213 nm.11,12 A homogeneous distribution of KOH in the
interrogated region was confirmed in this visualization measurement.
As shown in Figure 5a, spectrally resolved absorbance A(λ) of
different hot flue gases is obtained through the analysis of the collected
spectrum using the Beer–Lambert law:23 8  where I0(λ)
and Is(λ) are the UV light intensity
before and after the seeding of potassium to the hot gas, respectively, NA is the number density of the alkali species
in the hot gas, σA(λ) is the absorption cross-section
of alkali species, and L is the absorption path length.
In obtaining the absorption spectral curve shown in Figure 5a (also in Figure 6), the USB spectrometer was
set to have a gate width of 1 s, and 10 measurements were averaged
for each case; hence, it took 10 s to obtain the UV spectra of KOH
and KCl. In Figure 5a, the spectrum mainly consists of broadband absorption by KOH in
the hot gas,23 but the absorption lines
of K atoms were also observed at wavelengths of 404, 345, and 322
nm. Some dips in the absorbance curve near 283 and 310 nm indicate
the reduction of OH radicals in the hot gas with the seeding of potassium
species.23 UV absorption cross sections
of potassium species, which are required to retrieve the concentration
of KOH and KCl, are evaluated from the absorbance data and presented
in Figure 5b. The details
of the evaluation process will be described in the following section.

Results and Discussion
UV Absorption
Cross Sections of KOH and KCl
In the
present study, the UV absorption cross-section of KOH in a combustion
atmosphere was determined. In this evaluation, a constant amount of
K2CO3 was introduced into one fuel-lean flame
and one fuel-rich flame. The potassium chemistry results in the generation
of KOH and K atoms as the dominant potassium species in the hot flue
gas.24 In the fuel-lean case, KOH is the
dominant species, whereas, in the fuel-rich case, nearly half of the
potassium exists as K atoms. When changing from a fuel-lean flame
to a fuel-rich flame, the increase of the concentration of K atoms
will be equal to the reduction of KOH. Based on the measured K atom
concentrations for the lean and rich cases, the absorption cross sections
of KOH were evaluated using the measured absorbance difference of
KOH from the UV absorption spectroscopy. Derived from eq 8, the evaluation process can be
described with the following equation: 9  where N indicates the number
density of K atoms and KOH molecules in different flame cases. A(λ) indicates the absorbance of KOH in different
flames. σKOH(λ) represents the absorption cross-section
of KOH and L indicates the optical path length. The
subscripted prefixes “K” and “KOH” indicate
the potassium species while the subscripted root words “rich”
and “lean” indicate the corresponding flame case.

Flame 1 (ϕ = 0.67 and T = 1768 K) and Flame
5 (ϕ = 1.12 and T = 1843 K) were used to evaluate
the absorption cross-section of KOH at ∼1800 K. The absorbance
curves in these two flames obtained with seeding of the same amount
of K2CO3 are presented in Figure 5a. A detailed description of the absorption
spectrum of KOH is provided by Weng et al.23 Absorption of the OH radical (∼283 and 310 nm) and K atoms
(∼404 nm, 345 and 322 nm) can be observed, but are much narrower
than that of KOH. The absorbance of KOH in the lean case nearly doubles
the one in the rich case (cf. Figure 5a) and the difference was mainly caused by the difference
in KOH concentration between these two cases. The influence of the
temperature difference between these two cases (1768 K vs 1843 K)
is negligible, as reported by Weng et al.23 The measured number densities of K atoms in Flames 1 and 5 were
1.7 × 1018 m–3 and 4.87 × 1019 m–3, respectively. Thus, the absorption
cross-section of KOH at a temperature of ∼1800 K, as shown
in Figure 5b, was obtained
with eq 9, and is equal
to 1.1 × 10–21 m2/molecule at 327.3
nm and 1.29 × 10–21 m2/molecule
at 246.2 nm. Note that, by combining eqs 8 and 9, one can find that the
path length L can be cancelled to obtain the cross-section
values. In addition, the absorption cross-section of KOH at a temperature
of ∼1400 K was evaluated from measurements made in Flame 8
(ϕ = 0.67 and T = 1390 K) and Flame 10 (ϕ
= 1.31 and T = 1471 K). The obtained absorption cross-section
is presented in Figure 5b and has a value of 1.05 × 10–21 m2/molecule at 327.3 nm and 1.26 × 10–21 m2/molecule at 246.2 nm. It is about twice that used by Sorvajärvi
et al.17 near 320 nm, where it was approximated
to the cross-section of NaOH reported by Self and Plane.37 To the best of our knowledge, Figure 5b presents the first experimental
data on the UV absorption cross-section of KOH. Comparing the two
absorption cross-section profiles of KOH at temperatures around 1400
and 1800 K, it can be seen that the influence of temperature is small.
The average value of the cross sections at temperatures 1400 and 1800
K was therefore applied in the calculation of the concentration of
KOH in the following evaluation.

Furthermore, the UV absorption
cross-section of KCl in the high-temperature
gas was obtained. In order to generate KCl in the hot flue gas, CHCl3 was seeded into the premixed flame as the source of chlorine.
In the fuel-lean cases, with the seeding of K and Cl, the dominant
potassium species in the hot flue gas were KOH and KCl, while <2.5%
of the potassium formed K atoms, according to the measured concentration
of K atoms and the total potassium concentration obtained in the case
without the seeding of Cl. Especially in the low-temperature case,
Flame 9, there were almost no K atoms present. Hence, the potassium
balance is mainly between KOH and KCl. In the present investigations,
∼100 ppm of Cl was introduced into the flame while the concentration
of elemental potassium was maintained at ∼20 ppm. It was observed
that there was almost no KOH formed with the seeding of 100 ppm of
Cl, according to the structure of the absorption spectrum, as shown
in Figure 6a. Similar
results have been presented by Schofield38 on sodium chemistry and showed that NaCl became the dominant species
as chlorine was available in excess compared with sodium. The absorption
was solely from KCl, as it shows the same profile as the ones presented
in previous studies on the UV absorption of KCl.18−20,23 Consequently, the UV absorption cross-section of
KCl was obtained based on the Beer–Lambert law with the measured
absorbance of KCl in the flame (Figure 6a) and its corresponding concentration from the measured
concentration of KOH under the condition without Cl seeding.

 10  Figure 6b shows
the absorption cross-section of KCl at temperatures of ∼1800
and 1300 K with values of 2.3 × 10–21 m2/molecule and 2.26 × 10–21 m2/molecule, respectively, at a wavelength of 246.2 nm. The variation
of the cross-section with temperature is shown to be small, as concluded
by Leffler et al.20 In the following, the
value of 2.28 × 10–21 m2/molecule
at a wavelength of 246.2 nm was used in the KCl concentration evaluation.
The present value is ∼20% lower than the value from Leffler
et al.20 measured at a temperature of ∼1000
K, which is ∼28% higher than the values from Davidovits et
al.19 and Forsberg et al.18 at a temperature of ∼1100 K. In the measurements
by Leffler et al.20 and Davidovits et al.,19 sealed quartz cells generating controlled amounts
of KCl vapor were used, in which the evaluation of the KCl cross sections
strongly relied on the determination of the KCl vapor pressure in
the cell. The accuracy of the calculated KCl vapor pressure was directly
affected by the accuracy of the salt reservoir temperature.20 A possible uncertainty in measured temperature
of 15 K could cause an uncertainty in vapor pressure of more than
20%.20 Moreover, since a nearly saturated
KCl vapor was generated in the cell, there might be some additional
uncertainty induced by the formation of K2Cl2, as discussed by Leffler et al.20 Compared
with previous investigations, there are thus some advantages in the
present study. First, the measurement was made directly on the KCl
vapor in the combustion environment, in which the formation of the
K2Cl2 dimer was negligible at temperatures over
1300 K. Also, the evaluation of the absorption cross-section was based
on the measurement of the concentration of atomic K, which had a relatively
low uncertainty. According to the estimation of the error in the absorbance
curve-fitting process, the uncertainty was about ±2%. In addition,
about ±3% uncertainty can be introduced by the uncertainty of
around ±50 K in the TLAF temperature measurement of the hot gas.
In addition, uncertainty might originate from the inhomogeneity of
the potassium distribution in the hot flue gas. The inhomogeneity
was estimated through the distribution of the photofragmenation fluorescence
of KOH/KCl in the hot flue gas. The fluctuation of the concentration
of potassium in the measurement region was estimated to be below ±10%.
Moreover, under the rich condition, the secondary reactions occurred
with the ambient air to form a thin layer of flame front, which might
change the balance between KOH and K atoms. This influence should
be small considering the fact that the reaction zone was very small
with a thickness of <1% of the entire homogeneous reaction zone.
However, combining eqs 8 and 9, it can be found that the path length L can be canceled and there was almost no influence on the
determination of the absorption cross section. Hence, the total error
of the absorption cross section was estimated to be about ±5%
in the present study, without considering uncertainties in path length,
inhomogeneity of temperature, and possible secondary reactions.

Concentration Measurements of K Atoms, KOH, and KCl in Flames
Quantitative measurements of KOH, KCl, and atomic K were performed
to study the potassium–chlorine chemistry. To mimic different
oxidation and reduction environments, hot flue gases were prepared
from flames (Flames 1–7) with global equivalence ratios that
varied from 0.67 to 1.32. A constant amount of KCl was seeded into
the flames via KCl water solution. The concentrations of KOH, KCl,
and K atoms measured through broadband UV absorption spectroscopy
and TDLAS are shown in Figure 7 with a total amount of potassium being ∼22 ppm.

Figure 7 Concentration
of K atoms, KOH, KCl, and total K in the hot flue
gas versus global equivalence ratio with seeding of KCl. The concentration
of K atoms was measured by TDLAS both at 404.4 and 769.9 nm in the
fuel-lean cases. Note: the concentration in different cases was corrected
due to the difference in total flow rate shown in Table 1.

It is clear that there is a significant change of the concentration
for all the potassium species as the equivalence ratio varies from
lean to rich cases. For the lean cases, the concentrations of different
potassium species are almost kept constant. The KCl concentration
was ∼12 ppm, and the KOH had concentration of ∼10 ppm.
For the lean cases, the concentration of K atoms was measured both
by the 404.4 nm and the 769.9 nm TDLAS system. The results obtained
from these two methods agreed well, both giving a value of ∼0.3
ppm, which was much smaller than the concentrations of KCl and KOH.
It can be seen that there was only ∼1% potassium present in
the form of K atoms in the oxidation environment at a temperature
of 1800 K, while KCl and KOH concentrations constituted ∼55%
and ∼43%, respectively, of the total potassium. In the reduction
environments, the concentration of K atoms increased to 8 ppm, and
continually increased with equivalence ratio. The fraction of K atoms
became over 35% in reduction environments, in agreement with results
presented by Leffler et al.,15 indicating
that K atoms should be considered as one of the dominant species in
the reduction environment together with KCl and KOH, which had a fraction
of 37% and 28%, respectively. The formation of large amounts of K
atoms might be caused by the existence of a large amount of H radicals
in the reduction environments, which enhanced reactions between KCl/KOH
and H radicals.26,39 The ratio between the concentration
of KOH and the sum of KOH and KCl values was almost constant, even
in the fuel-rich flames, which indicates that chemical equilibrium
between KOH and KCl can be easily established.

Conclusions
In the present work, spectrally resolved UV absorption cross sections
of KOH and KCl in the wavelength range 200−480 nm and at temperatures
1300 K and 1800 K were, for the first time, obtained directly through
a reliable experimental method. The well-recognized spectral features
make it possible to perform simultaneous KOH and KCl measurement in
combustion environments. Meanwhile, the concentration of K atoms was
measured using TDLAS combining the absorption lines at 769.9 and 404.4
nm to cover a dynamic range of concentrations from several ppb up
to 20 ppm for a path length of 10 cm. Hence, all the major potassium
species, i.e., KOH, KCl, and K atoms, present in most biomass combustion/gasification
atmospheres, can be measured quantitatively. Using our experimental
setup, a constant amount of KCl was seeded into flames with varying
equivalence ratios and the concentrations of KOH, KCl, and K were
measured. The chemical balance between different potassium species
in different environments was accurately determined. These quantitative
techniques can be used for accurate investigations of potassium chemistry
and for potassium species monitoring in biomass combustors and gasifiers.
