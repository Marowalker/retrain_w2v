Sulfhydryl-containing
compounds, including thiols and hydrogen
sulfide (H2S), play important but differential roles in
biological structure and function. One major challenge in separating
the biological roles of thiols and H2S is developing tools
to effectively separate the reactivity of these sulfhydryl-containing
compounds. To address this challenge, we report the differential responses
of common electrophilic fluorescent thiol labeling reagents, including
nitrobenzofurazan-based scaffolds, maleimides, alkylating agents,
and electrophilic aldehydes, toward cysteine and H2S. Although
H2S reacted with all of the investigated scaffolds, the
photophysical response to each scaffold was significantly different.
Maleimide-based, alkylating, and aldehydic thiol labeling reagents
provided a diminished fluorescence response when treated with H2S. By contrast, nitrobenzofurazan-based labeling reagents
were deactivated by H2S addition. Furthermore, the addition
of H2S to thiol-activated nitrobenzofurazan-based reagents
reduced the fluorescence signal, thus establishing the incompatibility
of nitrobenzofurazan-based thiol labeling reagents in the presence
of H2S. Taken together, these studies highlight the differential
reactivity of thiols and H2S toward common thiol-labeling
reagents and suggest that sufficient care must be taken when labeling
or measuring thiols in cellular environments that produce H2S due to the potential for both false-positive and eroded responses.

==== Body
Sulfhydryl-containing
compounds,
such as cysteine (Cys), homocysteine (Hcy), glutathione (GSH), and
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are potent nucleophiles and play
diverse and important roles in biological structure and function.
As the only sulfhydryl-containing canonical α-amino acid, Cys
imparts significant effects on protein structure through its reversible
oxidation to form disulfide bonds with other cysteine residues.1 Similarly, Cys can function as a powerful nucleophile
in the active sites of enzymes operating under nucleophilic catalysis.2 Homocysteine, the methylene homologue of Cys,
also plays important biological roles and is a key sulfhydryl-containing
intermediate generated during the enzymatic generation of Cys from
methionine.3 Misregulation of Hcy is implicated
in various cardiovascular diseases and neuropsychiatric conditions,
and the elevated Hcy levels found in hyperhomocysteinemia have been
implicated in stroke, pre-eclampsia, and Alzeheimer’s disease.4−8 By comparison to the low micromolar concentrations of free Cys and
Hcy, GSH is present in much higher cellular concentrations (1–10
mM) and is the most abundant source of nonprotein sulfur.9−12 Glutathione plays key roles in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis
and provides protection against oxidative stress through its reversible
oxidation to glutathione disulfide (GSSG).

Although much less
understood than other sulfhydryl-containing
compounds, H2S has emerged as an important biological mediator
and is implicated to play important roles in the cardiovascular, neuronal,
endocrine, and immune systems.13−16 As the smallest sulfhydryl-containing molecule, H2S is now accepted as a gaseous signaling molecule, joining
nitric oxide and carbon monoxide as a cellular gasotransmitter.17,18 The majority of enzymatic H2S biosynthesis derives from
metabolism of sulfur-containing substrates, such as Cys and Hcy, by
cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine-γ-lyase
(CSE), as well as cysteine aminotransferase (CAT) working in concert
with 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST).13 In aqueous solution, H2S is significantly more
acidic (pKa1 6.9) than Cys (8.10), Hcy
(8.25), or GSH (8.72), which is manifested in that ∼80% of
H2S exists as HS– under physiological
conditions. Additionally, the small size and variable protonation
state of H2S, HS–, and S2– allows for modulation of lipid and water solubility. Taken together,
these physiochemical differences make H2S a significantly
more potent nucleophile than other biologically relevant sulfhydryl-containing
compounds. Additionally, owing to its diprotic nature, H2S can participate in two sequential nucleophilic attacks, by comparison
to the single nucleophilic addition possible for thiols.

Concomitant
with the emerging and multifaceted biological roles
of sulfhydryl-containing species, researchers have developed chemical
tools for selectively labeling and detecting thiols and H2S. Most chemical methods for thiol labeling rely on the high nucleophilicity
of thiols to covalently attach electrophilic labeling reagents. Using
this nucleophilic attack strategy, researchers have developed a diverse
palette of tools for thiol detection, quantification, and labeling
protein Cys residues, thus greatly enabling investigation into processes
associated with thiol biochemistry and redox homeostasis.19−22 By contrast, development of chemical tools for H2S detection
remains in early stages of development, with chemical tools emerging
only in the past few years.19,23−25 Such chemical tools have included fluorescent,26−40 visible,41 and chemiluminescent42 methods for H2S visualization and
quantification. Of such chemical tools, three primary strategies have
emerged, including H2S-mediated reduction,26−34 nucleophilic attack,35−39,43,44 and precipitation of transition metals,40 although the comparative efficacy of each approach under different
physiological conditions remains to be determined.

Although
most recently developed chemical tools for H2S detection
have been tested with thiols and afford moderate to good
selectivity for H2S over thiols, commonly used chemical
tools for thiol detection have not been evaluated with H2S. Because thiols and H2S share similar reactivity profiles,
electrophilic agents used to label thiols are expected to react with
H2S, although the resultant responses remain unknown. Although
biological thiol concentrations are typically higher than cellular
H2S levels (high nM to low μM), the constant enzymatic
production of H2S provides a continuous source of highly
nucleophilic sulfide.45,46 Evaluation of the reactivity
profiles, as well as the photophysical properties of the resultant
products of commonly used thiol labeling agents with thiols and H2S, is an important step toward separating the similar reactivities
of these important sulfhydryl-containing biomolecules. Furthermore,
these studies will provide insight into the potential cross-reactivity
of different labeling reagents and potential false-positive response
leading to experimental ambiguity. To investigate and address this
potential cross reactivity, we report here the differences between
thiol and H2S reactivity with common electrophilic tools
for fluorescent detection and labeling of thiols and highlight the
differential responses of different classes of electrophilic reagents
toward thiols and H2S.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
General
NMR spectra were acquired
on either a Varian
INOVA 500 or Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C. Deuterated
solvents were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Fluorescence
spectra were obtained on a Photon Technology International (PTI) Quanta
Master 40 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a Quantum Northwest TLC-50
temperature controller. All cuvette-based spectroscopic measurements
were made under anaerobic conditions, with solutions prepared under
an inert atmosphere in 1.0 cm path length septum-sealed cuvettes obtained
from Starna Scientific. Differential interference contrast (DIC) and
fluorescent images were obtained using a Nikon Eclipse Ti Inverted
Microscope equipped with a 20× APO ELWD objective using the NIS-Elements
acquisition software. Cells used in live imaging experiments were
incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 during imaging. All
fluorescent images were corrected by applying identical intensity
cutoffs to exclude background noise. Fluorescent data were analyzed
using ImageJ software.47 All statistical
comparisons were performed using Prism.48

Spectroscopic Materials and Methods
Piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)
(PIPES, Aldrich) and KCl (99.999%, Aldrich) were used to prepare buffered
solutions (50 mM PIPES, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.0) with Millipore water.
Buffered solutions were deoxygenated by vigorous sparging with nitrogen
for at least 2 h. Samples for all spectroscopic measurements were
prepared in an Innovative Technology N2-filled glovebox
with O2 levels less than 1.0 ppm. Anhydrous sodium hydrogen
sulfide (NaSH) was purchased from Strem Chemicals and handled under
nitrogen. Thiol labeling reagents 1 and 2 were obtained from TCI, 4 from Sigma-Aldrich, 5 from Echelon Biosciences, and 3 and 6 were prepared as described in the literature.41,49−51 GYY4137 was prepared according to the published procedure.52 Stock solutions of the different thiol probes
were prepared in deoxygenated DMSO and stored in aliquots at −25
°C under nitrogen until immediately prior to use.

General Procedure
for Fluorescent Studies
Stock solutions
of each probe (10 mM) in DMSO were prepared in a glovebox. A 13 mL
solution of each probe (5 μM) in pH 7.0 PIPES buffer was prepared,
and 3.0 mL of the solution was distributed to individual cuvettes
containing a stir bar and a septum cap. After removal from the glovebox,
initial fluorescent readings were recorded, after which each probe
was treated with 50 μM Cys or NaSH by syringe and monitored
for 60 min. To investigate the effects of added NaSH after Cys addition,
each reagent was incubated with 50 μM Cys for 60 min, after
which 500 μM NaSH was added, and the cuvette was monitored for
an additional 60 min. For each fluorescence experiment, reagents 1–3 were excited at 465 nm, 4 at 340 nm, 5 at 392 nm, and 6 at 365 nm.
Fluorescence measurements are reported as integrated emissions over
an emission window sufficient to capture the complete emission profile
of each reagent.

Cell Culture and Imaging Materials and Methods
HeLa
cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle Medium (DMEM, GIBCO, MediaTek, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS, HyClone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells
were passed and plated into six-well dishes (MatTek) containing 3.0
mL of DMEM and were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Prior to imaging, cells were washed with 1.5 mL of Dulbecco’s
Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS) and then bathed in 3.0 mL of DMEM
without phenol red indicator supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin
during imaging. For cell imaging experiments, cells were treated with 1 or 4 (10 μM) and Hoechst 33258 nuclear
dye (2.5 μM) in DMEM without phenol red indicator supplemented
with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and monitored over a period of 30
min. The cells were then treated with NaSH (200 μM) or GYY4137
(400 μM) and monitored for an additional 60 and 90 min, respectively.

Results
Because common fluorescent reagents for thiol
labeling are typically
activated by nucleophilic attack of the thiol on an electrophilic
moiety of the probe reagent, we reasoned that H2S, which
is a more potent nucleophile, could potentially react with and activate
common thiol detection reagents. Additionally, we wanted to determine
whether the thiol reaction products of such probes are stable in the
presence of H2S. To investigate such potential reactivity
differences we chose electrophilic thiol labeling reagents including
nitrobenzofurazan electrophiles (NBD-Cl, 1; NBD-F, 2; (NBD)2S, 3), fluorophore-bound
maleimides (N-(1-pyrene)maleimide, 4), fluorescent alkylating agents (monobromobimane, 5), and electrophilic aldehydes (coumarin carbaldehyde, 6) due to their broad application in thiol labeling, detection, and
quantification, as well as their different electrophilic moieties
(Figure 1). To probe the differential reactivity
of each class of characteristic probe toward H2S and thiols,
we measured the fluorescence response upon treatment with H2S and Cys individually.

Figure 1 Commonly used reagents for labeling and detection
of cellular thiols
that were used to investigate the potential cross-reactivity with
H2S.

To determine the reaction
profiles of each reagent with thiols,
we incubated 5 μM solutions of compounds 1–6 with 10 equiv of Cys at 37 °C and monitored the subsequent
fluorescence response (Figure 2). As expected,
each scaffold produced a fluorescence response upon the addition of
Cys. After verifying the Cys-derived fluorescence response, we repeated
each experiment with an equivalent amount of H2S. Although 1–6 produced a fluorescence response to
Cys, only 4–6 produced a fluorescent
response to H2S. This observed response, however, was significantly
lower than that observed for Cys. Although treatment of 1–3 with H2S did not generate a fluorescence
response, a significant color change was observed (vide infra), which is consistent with the formation of NBD-SH.41

Figure 2 Fluorescent data for (a) 1, (b) 2, (c) 3, (d) 4, (e) 5, and (f) 6 reacting with Cys (−■−) or H2S (−○−).
Conditions: pH 7.0, 50 mM PIPES buffer, 100 mM KCl, 37 °C, 5
μM thiol probe, 10 equiv of Cys or H2S. Data were
acquired at t = 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min
after addition. Error bars represent ± SE, n = 4.

On the basis of the observed reactivity
of 1–6 toward H2S, we
next investigated whether the
fluorescent signal generated from the thiol reaction products of 1–6 could be affected by treatment with
H2S. To test this potential reactivity, 5 μM solutions
of 1–6 were treated with 10 equiv
of Cys for 60 min, followed by 100 equiv of H2S for an
additional 60 min. For nitrobenzofurazan compounds 1–3, the addition of H2S resulted in a significant
reduction of the fluorescence response, signifying that the thiol-reaction
products are not stable toward H2S (Figure 3a–c). By contrast, reagents 4–6 showed negligible change after H2S addition (Figure 3d–f), highlighting the different reactivity
profiles of commonly used thiol labeling reagents.

Cys for (a) 1, (b) 2, (c) 3, (d) 4, (e) 5, and (f) 6.
Conditions: pH 7.0, 50 mM PIPES buffer, 100 mM KCl, 37 °C, 5
μM thiol probe, 10 equiv of Cys followed by 100 equiv of H2S. Data were acquired at t = 0, 1, 5, 10,
15, 30, 45, and 60 min after Cys addition and at t = 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after H2S addition.
Error bars represent ± SE, n = 4, ns = not significant,
* = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01,
*** = p < 0.001.

To further demonstrate the prevalence of the observed reactivity,
we used fluorescent microscopy to determine whether the same fluorescence
response was observed in live cells. We chose 1 as the
representative example from nitrobenzofurazan-based probes due to
its significant reduction in fluorescence after treatment of the thiol
ligated product with H2S. Similarly, 4 was
chosen as a control reactant due to its lack of reactivity toward
H2S. For live-cell imaging studies, HeLa cells were incubated
with 1 or 4 (10 μM) for 30 min, after
which either H2S or GYY4137, a common slow-releasing H2S donor,52 was added. Treatment
of HeLa cells with 1 (Figure 4a) or 4 (Figure 4d) for 30 min
resulted in a fluorescence response consistent with intracellular
thiol labeling. Upon the addition of H2S or GYY4137, however,
a significant decrease in fluorescence was observed for compound 1 (Figure 4b,c), but no fluorescence
change was observed for compound 4 (Figure 4e,f). Furthermore, differences in both the magnitude and rate
of fluorescence decrease from 1 were observed upon the
addition of H2S and GYY4137 (Figure 4g), which is consistent with the H2S release profiles
of these two sulfide sources. The cell based studies of 1 and 4 match the cuvette-based experiment and highlight
the incompatibility of nitrobenzofurazan-based thiol labeling reagents
with H2S, even after thiol ligation.

with 1 and 4 (10 μM) for 30 min and
then incubated with added PIPES buffer at pH 7.4 (a, d), H2S (200 μM) (b, e), or GYY4137 (400 μM) for 60 min (c,
f). Integrated cellular fluorescence from individual HeLa cells (g)
incubated with 1 and 4 after the addition
of pH 7.4 PIPES buffer, H2S, or GYY4137. Conditions: 10
μM thiol probe, 200 μM or 400 μM analyte, 37 °C,
5% CO2. Data were acquired at t = 0, 1,
10, 15, and 30 min after thiol probe addition and at t = 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after analyte addition. Error bars represent
± SE, n = 30, ns = not significant, * = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.01.

Discussion
The observed differential
reactivity of H2S and thiols
toward 1–6 highlights the need for
a judicious choice of thiol labeling reagents for experiments in which
elevated endogenous H2S levels are present. Furthermore,
because both thiols and H2S play important roles in cellular
redox chemistry and homeostasis, the possible cross-reactivity of
H2S with thiol labeling reagents requires significant consideration
during experimental design. For example, because nitrobenzofurazan-based
reagents are deactivated by H2S, both before and after
reaction with thiols, such reagents have poor utility for experiments
in which H2S is present. Alternatively, although electrophilic
reagents 4–6 can react quickly with
H2S to generate a small false-positive fluorescence response,
the thiol reaction products are stable in the presence of H2S, thus highlighting their greater utility of these reagents for
experiments in which H2S is present.

Although the
exogenous levels of H2S used in the experiments
(200 μM) are higher than basal cellular H2S levels,
these concentrations were used to balance the rate of reaction with
NBD-electrophiles and cell viability. Additionally, previous studies
have demonstrated that much of administered exogenous H2S is quickly metabolized, resulting in lower actual levels of accessible
sulfide.53 Based on cuvette-based studies,
we expect that the same deactivation of nitrobenzofurazan-based reagents
and erosion of nitrobenzofurazan-labeled thiols will still occur in
a cellular environment at lower H2S concentrations, albeit
at a diminished rate. By contrast to NaSH, administration of a slow-release
H2S donor, such as GYY4137, provides a continuous low level
of H2S and thus is typically administered at higher dosages
to generate physiological effects. The GYY4137 concentrations used
here (400 μM) are equivalent to those used in previous biological
experiments and assays.54,55 The above considerations
suggest that nitrobenzofurazan-based thiol labeling reagents should
not be used in experiments in which exogenous H2S, either
from NaSH or sulfide donors, is administered. Additionally, exposure
of nitrobenzofurazan-labeled thiols to endogenous H2S over
prolonged time periods may provide deleterious effects.

To further
determine the different pathways by which Cys and H2S react
with thiol labeling reagents 1–6 and
subsequently increase the generality of the observed
differential reactivity, we investigated the mechanisms by which probe
activation or deactivation occurred. Although 1–3 react with both Cys and H2S, only the Cys reaction
product is fluorescent. Upon reaction of 1–3 with Cys, however, the Cys-bound adduct remains sufficiently
electrophilic to further react with H2S to generate NBD-SH
(Scheme 1). This subsequent H2S
reaction is irreversible, which we demonstrated previously in the
study of the reactivity of NBD-based electrophiles toward H2S.41 Taken together, this reactivity is
consistent with the observed abolishment of the NBD-Cys fluorescence
upon H2S addition and suggests that NBD-based thiol labeling
reagents are incompatible with systems in which H2S is
generated.

Scheme 1 Reaction Pathways of Nitrobenzofurazan-Based Thiol
Labeling Reagents
(1–3) with Cys and H2S
By contrast to the NBD scaffolds,
the thiol-ligated product formed
upon reaction of 4 with Cys is not sufficiently electrophilic
to react further with H2S. This difference in reactivity
is consistent with the stable fluorescence response observed upon
treatment of the Cys-ligated 4 with H2S. Although
H2S does not reduce the response from Cys-ligated 4, H2S can still react with 4 to generate
a fluorescent product, although the magnitude of this response is
lower than that observed for Cys alone. When H2S reacts
with 4, the initial thiomaleimide product could further
react with a second equiv of 4 to generate a dipyrenyl
thioether (Scheme 2) leading to a mixture of
mono- and dipyrenyl adduct formation. The dipyrenyl adduct would be
expected to exhibit distinct photophysical properties from the Cys
reaction product due to the close proximity of two pyrene moieties.
Upon measuring the emission spectra of the reaction products from 4 with Cys and 4 with H2S we observed
the appearance of a new fluorescence band at 455 nm upon treatment
with H2S. This bathochromic and broad emission band is
consistent with pyrene excimer formation,56−59 which would be expected from
formation of dipyrenyl thioether formation upon reaction with H2S (Figure 5). Supporting this hypothesis,
mass spectrometric analysis of the reaction products revealed products
with m/z values of 629.1510 and
651.1335 which match those expected for the dipyrenyl thioether product
(m/z calculated for M + H+, 629.1535; M + Na+, 651.1354). In addition to highlighting
the differential reactivity of 4 toward H2S and Cys, the different photophysical properties of the H2S reaction product provides a potential platform on which thiol and
H2S reactivity can be separated.

Scheme 2 Reaction Pathways
of 4 with Cys and H2S
Figure 5 Emission spectra of 4, 4 + Cys, and 4 + H2S. Reaction with H2S generates
a new band at 455 nm that is consistent with pyrene exicmer formation.
Conditions: pH 7.0, 50 mM PIPES buffer, 100 mM KCl, 37 °C, 5
μM 4, and 10 equiv of Cys or NaSH.

Following similar reactivity to 4,
monobromobimane
(5) reacts quickly with thiols to form fluorescent bimane-thiol
adducts and is a common reagent for thiol labeling and quantification
by HPLC.60−62 Much like 4, the bimane-Cys conjugate
is unreactive toward H2S due to the thermodynamic stability
of the thioether product. Upon reaction of 5 with H2S, however, the bimanethiol generated during the first nucleophilic
attack remains sufficiently nucleophilic to react with a second equiv
of 5 to form fluorescent sulfide dibimane (SdB), thus
paralleling the observed reactivity of 4. The addition
of 2 equiv of 5 to trap H2S as stable SdB
is well established and has been identified and used as a robust method
for quantifying endogenous H2S concentrations using fluorescence
HPLC.43,44,63 Taken together,
the reactivity of 5 toward H2S and Cys matches
that observed for 4, in that reaction with either H2S or Cys produces a florescent product, although the reaction
stoichiometries of these two pathways are different (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Reaction Pathway of 5 with
Cys and H2S
Use of aldehydic electrophiles is also an effective strategy
for
thiol detection. Such constructs, especially with ortho-hydroxy groups,
have been used as selective labeling reagents for Cys and Hcy due
to formation of a hydrogen-bond stabilized fluorescent thiazolidine
product.64−67 Unlike electrophilic 4 and 5, in which
H2S addition results in the formation of a nucleophilic
thiol intermediate, the addition of H2S to aldehyde-based
electrophiles, such as 6, should produce a significantly
lesser nucleophilic thiol product. For example, when 6 is treated with H2S, addition of H2S to the
aldehyde generates the (mercapto)benzylalcohol adduct, which exhibits
a diminished fluorescence response by comparison to Cys. To confirm
that such nucleophilic addition was occurring, we treated 6 with H2S and monitored the subsequent reaction by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Upon the addition of H2S, the
aldehydic 1H NMR signal at 10.1 ppm shifted upfield to
8.4 ppm, consistent with nucleophilic attack on the aldehyde by H2S (Figure 6). Similarly, the 13C{1H} NMR resonance corresponding to the aldehyde carbon
shifts from 192 to 62 ppm, which is also consistent with nucleophilic
addition of sulfide to the aldehyde (Figure S3). Unlike 4 and 5, this resultant thiol
does not further react with a second electrophile but rather forms
a stable final product.

(b) H2S.

Conclusion
Investigation of the
reaction of H2S with commonly used
electrophilic thiol labeling reagents revealed highly differential
responses between different classes of thiol-detection scaffolds.
Both cuvette- and cell-based studies revealed that thiol probes based
on nitrobenzofurazan scaffolds are deactivated by H2S.
Furthermore, the initial response generated upon reaction with thiols
is decreased by the addition of H2S, suggesting that nitrobenzofurazan-based
thiol detection platforms are not compatible with cellular experiments
in which H2S generation is prevalent. By contrast, the
fluorescence response of other electrophilic thiol probes tested is
not reduced upon the addition of H2S. In the absence of
thiols, however, these probes also react with H2S to generate
products with lower fluorescence signals. Taken together, these studies
highlight the differential reactivity of sulfhydryl-containing compounds
toward common thiol-labeling reagents and suggest that sufficient
care must be taken when labeling or measuring thiols in cellular environments
that produce H2S due to the potential for false-positive
as well as erroneously reduced responses.
