We present an innovative centrifugal
microfluidic immunoassay platform
(SpinDx) to address the urgent biodefense and public health need for
ultrasensitive point-of-care/incident detection of botulinum toxin.
The simple, sample-to-answer centrifugal microfluidic immunoassay
approach is based on binding of toxins to antibody-laden capture particles
followed by sedimentation of the particles through a density-media
in a microfluidic disk and quantification by laser-induced fluorescence.
A blind, head-to-head comparison study of SpinDx versus the gold-standard
mouse bioassay demonstrates 100-fold improvement in sensitivity (limit
of detection = 0.09 pg/mL), while achieving total sample-to-answer
time of <30 min with 2-μL required volume of the unprocessed
sample. We further demonstrate quantification of botulinum toxin in
both exogeneous (human blood and serum spiked with toxins) and endogeneous
(serum from mice intoxicated via oral, intranasal, and intravenous
routes) samples. SpinDx can analyze, without any sample preparation,
multiple sample types including whole blood, serum, and food. It is
readily expandable to additional analytes as the assay reagents (i.e.,
the capture beads and detection antibodies) are disconnected from
the disk architecture and the reader, facilitating rapid development
of new assays. SpinDx can also serve as a general-purpose immunoassay
platform applicable to diagnosis of other conditions and diseases.

==== Body
Botulinum
neurotoxin (BoNT),
the most toxic substance known to man,1−3 remains one of the highest
priority biological threat agents. It is easy to produce, and minute
amounts are sufficient to kill a person. One gram of holotoxin, evenly
dispersed, has the potential to incapacitate 100,000 adults.4 A 2001 Canadian report estimated that BoNT exposure
to 100,000 people would result in 30,000 deaths and a total economic
cost of $8.9 billion due to costly and long-term management of intoxication.5 It also remains a threat for public health in
the form of foodborne, wound, and infant botulism. The extreme toxicity
requires ultrasensitive diagnostic assays with detection limits well
below the minimal lethal dose to allow timely administration of therapeutics.

Current diagnostic technology is limited to the live-mouse bioassay
as the only FDA-approved metric for confirming the presence of active
BoNT in a sample.4,6−8 The mouse bioassay,
while sensitive, requires days for result confirmation thus rendering
it ineffective for timely therapeutic mitigation. The mouse assay
is also extremely costly, and public health laboratories spend millions
of dollars every year to maintain and operate a mouse facility for
screening. Moreover, only a few specialized laboratories in the country
are capable of performing mouse bioassays. Therefore, in a suspected
bioterrorism incident samples must be collected, preserved, and shipped
to these laboratories for analysis, wasting precious time before a
positive identification is made. Last, but not least, there are ethical
concerns related to the use of mice for toxin testing.

There
is an urgent need for rapid, sensitive, and accurate detection/diagnosis
of BoNTs for swift and effective utilization of limited medical countermeasures
to save lives and minimize socioeconomic impact. Passive immunization
remains the only available therapeutic approach; timely administration
of anti-BoNT antibodies to clear toxin from the bloodstream greatly
improves the speed of patient recovery. To this end, several new in vitro assay platforms have been proposed in the literature9−19 as well as improvements to the existing in vivo assay.20,21 While many of these assays have the advantage
of improved sensitivity, such as the ALISSA technique capable of detection
of attomolar concentrations,15,22 the technology often
relies on complex sample processing steps and long incubation times
that do not meet usability requirements for point-of-care or point-of-incident
diagnostic applications. A few field-deployable assays (strip or lateral-flow
immunoassays) are available23−25 but suffer from major limitations
including poor detection limit and inability to provide quantitative
results.

We describe a centrifugal microfluidic platform (SpinDx)
suitable
for both laboratory-based as well as potential point-of-care/incident
detection of BoNTs. Centrifugal microfluidics based biochemical analysis
devices26−29 have attracted significant attention in the past few years as evidenced
by numerous reports and commercial instruments. Madou’s group
has implemented traditional ELISA chemistry in a homogeneous phase
for detecting proteins including Dengue viral NS1 protein.30 The commercially available Gyrolab (Gyros, Inc.)
utilizes a packed bed of streptavidin-coated particles with multiple
reagent dispensing steps controlled by capillary and centrifugal forces
to perform immunoassays and other methods.31 The reagents wash through the column through application of centrifugal
force followed by interrogation by laser-based detection. The system
developed by the Samsung Biomedical Research Institute utilizes a
system of ferrowax valves individually actuated by heating with an
IR laser to implement immunoassays using surface-immobilized affinity
reagents.29 Zengerle et al. demonstrated
picomolar detection of BoNT/A based on a luciferase reporter bound
to microparticles in a centrifugal microfluidic system (LabDisk).32 An N-terminal HaloTag is used for bead attachment
with two tandem repeats of SNAP-25 connecting the C-terminal luciferase.
After cleavage of the SNAP-25 motif by the endopeptidase activity
of the toxin, the bioluminescent signal can be detected in solution
after removal of the solid support. We present a centrifugal microfluidic
platform (Figure 1) for detection of botulinum
toxin based on an innovative sedimentation-based immunoassay developed
recently by our group.33 The sample is
mixed with a detection cocktail consisting of a) capture beads coated
with antibodies specific for the target(s) of interest and b) detection
antibodies labeled with a fluorescent tag, which will be bound to
the capture bead in the presence of the corresponding antigen (Figure 1A). Following incubation, the beads are separated
from the sample via sedimentation through a density media that inherently
washes the beads and removes any interfering agents as the beads stack
at the end of the channel (periphery of the disk) (Figure 1B). The fluorescent signal of the resulting bead
pellet is used to quantify the analyte present (Figure 1C). SpinDx was used for detection of botulinum toxin and outperformed
the gold-standard mouse bioassay with respect to ease-of-use (completely
automated requiring no manual sample preparation), sensitivity (100-fold
limit of detection improvement), and time of assay (less than 30 min).
The device is compatible with both clinical and nonclinical samples
making it a universal platform for detection and quantification of
BoNT and other protein analytes.

capture beads and a fluorescent detection antibody in solution, loaded

from background sample contaminants and unbound label. C) Dose–response

can be found in the Supporting Information.

Biological Safety Considerations
Botulinum neurotoxins
are the most deadly substance known. The amount necessary to cause
harm (including paralysis and death) are minute (1 ng/kg). Extreme
caution needs to be exercised while handling the toxin, particularly
in powder form. Always use a Class 2 biosafety cabinet with appropriate
personal protective equipment (safety glasses, gloves, lab coat) and
avoid the use of sharps. Avoid generation of aerosols. Biological
and sharps waste must be disposed according to federal, state, local,
and institutional guidelines.

Human Samples
Whole human blood was purchased from
Innovative Technologies (Novi, MI) and used without further treatment.
Though the blood tested negative for a variety of blood-borne pathogens,
it is important to observe universal precautions in the handling of
potentially infectious materials. According to HHS regulations 45
CFR Part 46, publically available, commercially acquired, pooled,
and deidentified human whole blood does not constitute human subjects
research. As such, it is not subject to Institutional Review Board
or Human Studies Board review. Protocols adhered to institutional
guidelines approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee.

Monoclonal
Antibody Development (Western Regional Research Center,
USDA)
Mouse anti-BoNT/A monoclonal antibodies (F1-2, F1-40,
F1-51, and F2-43) used in this study were generated following immunization
of Balb/c mice with BoNT toxoid.34 Animal
protocols adhered to institutional guidelines approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Western
Regional Research Center.

Antibody-Microparticle Conjugation
Conjugation of the
capture antibody to the microparticle proceeded via standard carbodiimide
chemistry. Silica microparticles prefunctionalized with carboxylic
acid groups were activated equimolar amounts of N-ethyl-N′-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide)
(EDC) and of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) at pH 6.4
in 100 mM 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) to form the succinimidyl
ester. The capture antibody was added, and the solution was raised
to pH 8.15 and reacted at 4 °C for 2 h. The particles were then
twice blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at 4 °C.
The particles were then washed in wash buffer (138 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM
KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 0.05% (w/v) Tween-20, 0.05%
(w/v) Pluronic F127, 0.05% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, 7.6 mM NaN3, 0.1% (w/v) BSA) and resuspended
in wash buffer to a concentration of 5% solids.

Antibody-Quantum
Dot Conjugation
Detection antibodies
were labeled with quantum dots using standard EDC/NHS carbodiimide
chemistry. Carboxylic acid-terminated quantum dots were conjugated
to the detection antibody with equimolar amounts of EDC/NHS at room
temperature for 30 min with stirring. The reaction was spun through
a desalting column made of Sephacryl S400HR, and the first fraction
was taken as the quantum dot-antibody conjugate. Degree of labeling
was determined using the published value for UV absorption of the
quantum dot, and the protein concentration was determined using a
bicinchoninic acid protein assay (BCA).

SpinDx Immuonassay Protocol
Immunoassays were performed
in technical triplicate. Standard curves were collected by diluting
BoNT/A in fetal bovine serum (FBS) as the sample matrix. To 7 μL
of a 5% solids suspension of capture particles was added 1 μL
of a 300 nM solution of quantum dot-labeled detection antibody. To
this suspension was added 7 μL of the BoNT/A-spiked FBS to yield
20 nM final concentration of detection antibody. The suspension was
incubated with mixing for 20 min at room temperature. Each channel
of the disk was preloaded with 3 μL of a density medium consisting
of 90% Percoll in phosphate buffered saline (PBS [138 mM NaCl, 2.7
mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4]) with 0.05% (w/v)
Tween 20, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, and 0.1% (w/v) F127. After incubation, 4
μL of the suspension was added to the channel, and the disk
was spun at 8000 rpm for 45 s. The bead pellet was analyzed on an
Olympus IX-70 fluorescence microscope with 405 nm excitation and 705
nm emission, a CoolSnap HQ interline CCD camera (Roper Scientific,
Trenton, NJ), and Image-Pro Plus imaging software (MediaCybernetics,
Bethesda, MD). The average fluorescence of each bead pellet was measured
and compared with calibration curves generated in parallel with standard
dilutions to quantify the target analyte.

Mouse Intranasal Intoxication
and Sample Collection (UMass Dartmouth)
Swiss-Webster female
mice (22 to 25- g) were purchased from Charles
River Laboratories, Inc. (Wilmington, MA). Intranasal toxin application
was carried out by first lightly anesthetizing mice with isoflurane
(Isothesia, Abbott Laboratories North, Chicago, IL). Toxin was administered
by single application of 20 μL solution to the nares at doses
of 50-ng, 500-ng, and 5-μg. Care was taken to avoid generation
of aerosol during the administration of the toxin. The heads of animals
were maintained in an upright position to minimize drainage into the
posterior pharynx. Blood samples were collected at 30 min and 60 min
postintoxication via retro-orbital bleeding. Serum was separated by
centrifugation at 1665xg for 16 min, stored at −20 °C,
and shipped to Sandia National Laboratories for analysis. All procedures
involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth
(2003).

Mouse Intravenous and Oral Intoxication and Sample Collection
(Western Regional Research Center, USDA)
For oral dosing,
4–5 week old female Swiss-Webster mice were treated with 100
μL of BoNT/A complex (dose levels 500, 5000 or 50,000 ng/mL)
or with the same volume of control phosphate gelatin buffer via gavage
using Popper feeding needles. Surviving mice were monitored for at
least 7 days following experiments for signs of intoxication. For
intravenous mouse treatments, mice were injected with 100 μL
of BoNT/A holotoxin (500, 5000, or 50,000 pg/mL) or with the same
volume of phosphate gelatin buffer control via the lateral tail vein.
Blood and samples were incubated on ice for at least 30 min before
centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 min to separate sera from the cellular
fraction. Samples were then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C
before analysis. Animal protocols adhere to institutional guidelines
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Western Regional Research Center.

Mouse Bioassay
(Western Regional Research Center, USDA)
Samples consisting
of serial dilutions of BoNT/A holotoxin in phosphate
gelatin buffer were prepared, blinded, and shared with Sandia National
Laboratories for parallel analysis via SpinDx, ELISA, and the live
mouse bioassay on the same day. Random groups of 10 Swiss Webster
mice (females 4–5 weeks old) were injected with 500 μL
of each dosage level intraperitoneally. Animals were monitored for
7 days for signs of intoxication (wasp-waist phenotype, labored breathing,
and paralysis) or death. Moribund animals were humanely euthanized
and counted as dead.

ELISA Protocol
The capture ELISA
used here was previously
described.34 Results from a typical analysis
of standards are shown in Figure S1.

Statistical Analysis
All data were subjected to statistical
analysis with OriginPro 9.1 (OriginLabs, Cambridge, MA). Goodness
of fit is reported as χ-squared and r-squared values, and limits
of detection and quantification are formally defined through IUPAC
convention: 3-times the standard deviation of the blank and 10-times
the standard deviation of the blank, respectively.

Results
and Discussion
SpinDx Immunoassay
An overview of
the centrifugal sedimentation
assay protocol is shown in Figure 1A and B,
depicted for multiplexed analysis of a drop of whole blood. An equal
volume of the sample is mixed and incubated at room temperature with
a suspension comprising capture antibody-functionalized beads (1-μm
silica microparticles) and an unbound fluorescently labeled detection
antibody. The sample/detection suspension is loaded on top of a preloaded
density medium in a channel embedded on the disk. During centrifugation,
the microparticles (with density greater than that of the density
medium) sediment through the density medium and pellet at the bottom
of the channel (periphery of the disk). The fluorescence of the microparticle
pellet is measured to quantify concentration of the target analyte
in the sample. The entire assay requires less than 30 min (compared
to several hours for other in vitro assay approaches
or days for the live-mouse bioassay). Furthermore, the scale of the
device allows for small samples sizes (2-μL per sample), whereas
other assays typically use much larger volumes (100-μL for ELISA
or 500-μL for the mouse bioassay). Figures 1C and 4B show calibration curves for
BoNT/A spiked in serum and other matrices. The SpinDx assay is both
sensitive (limit of detection ∼0.09 pg/mL, defined as 3 standard
deviation above background signal) and has a wide dynamic range (8
orders of magnitude) for BoNT/A spiked in fetal bovine serum.

SpinDx Assays
Are Ultrasensitive
Due to their extreme
toxicities, high sensitivity is an essential requirement for detection
of botulinum toxin in both clinical and food samples. We achieved
subfemtomolar sensitivity that greatly surpassed conventional diagnostic
methods (100-fold more sensitive than the ELISAs developed by the
USDA researchers34,35 and National Biodefense Analysis
and Countermeasures Center (NBACC)). The enhanced sensitivity of the
SpinDx assay is attributed to several unique features of the sedimentation
approach, including the following: a) 1-μm beads provide a capture
surface ∼320× larger than a standard 96-well microtiter
plate; b) isolating the capture beads from the sample and excess label
during the sedimentation step inherently washes the beads with several
hundred times the particle volume significantly reducing the background
signal without requiring separate wash steps; c) pelleting the beads
at the end of the channel permits averaging of signal over thousands
of beads; and d) the use of quantum dots as the detection label provides
a large (300 nm) Stokes shift thereby further reducing autofluorescence
and background noise. Quantum dots are also resistant to photobleaching
allowing for longer signal acquisition times to improve signal. Quantum
dot-antibody conjugates are known to enhance fluorescent assay sensitivities
while maintaining antibody reactivity.36−38 Intra- and interassay
coefficients of variation are low (intra: 4.3%, inter: 7.2%) indicating
that the antibodies exhibit good consistency.

Detection
of Botulinum Toxin in Intoxicated Animal Models
Rapid and
sensitive detection of BoNT/A from intoxicated patients
is extremely important for accurate diagnosis, effective therapeutic
intervention, and public health awareness.39,40 However, it is impractical and unethical to perform human exposure
studies with biotoxins. Hence, we explored BoNT/A quantification in
the peripheral serum collected from intoxicated mice. Swiss-Webster
mice (4–5 week old female) were intoxicated with BoNT/A by
three routes of exposure: intravenous and intranasal intoxication
(simulating aerosolized exposure) with BoNT/A holotoxin and oral intoxication
with BoNT/A complex (simulating food-borne contamination). Exposure
doses were chosen to bracket the LD50 for each intoxication
route based on previous studies.6,41,42 Blood was drawn at 30 min and 60 min postintoxication for the intravenous
and intranasal exposure groups and 1-h and 7-h postintoxication for
the oral exposure groups. As shown in Figures 2A–C, SpinDx was able to detect the presence of BoNT/A in the
serum from all three groups. Furthermore, the assay’s low limit
of detection detected trace concentrations of BoNT/A not previously
measured in mouse serum, such as in mice orally exposed to 500-ng
BoNT/A complex (a nonlethal dose). As expected, the relative amount
of BoNT/A in the serum of orally exposed mice was lower than that
from the intravenous and intranasal routes due to destruction of the
toxin by the digestive system; previously, it has been shown that
the LD50 from oral exposure is several orders of magnitude
higher than from other routes of intoxication.6,43,44 Also note the rapid decrease in BoNT/A concentration
in the peripheral serum of the intravenous and intranasal exposure
groups due to clearance and translocation to internal organs and tissues.
This result highlights the importance of rapid diagnostic analysis
following exposure to the toxin.

Figure 2 SpinDx quantification of BoNT/A holotoxin
in peripheral serum of
intoxicated mice due to (A) intravenous intoxication with BoNT/A holotoxin,
(B) intranasal intoxication with BoNT/A holotoxin, and (C) oral intoxication
with BoNT/A complex. Samples were each run in triplicate; error bars
represent standard error of the mean (SEM).

Immunoassays Results Correlate Well with Gold Standard Mouse
Bioassays and ELISAs
Botulinum Immunoassays Exceed Sensitivity
of Gold Standard Mouse
Bioassays
We also conducted a direct, head-to-head comparison
of the SpinDx botulinum assay with the mouse bioassay (n = 10 animals per dilution). Freshly prepared serial dilutions of
purified BoNT/A toxin in gelatin-phosphate diluent were blinded, shared,
and analyzed on the same day by each assay. 4–5 week old Swiss
Webster mice were observed for 4 days postexposure (following the
standard mouse bioassay protocol,35 whereas
results from the SpinDx platform were available after 30 min). Only
the highest 4 concentrations (2, 10, 50, and 100 pg/mL) were tested
by the mouse bioassay to reduce animal usage. Results from the study
are shown in Figure 3A. The mouse bioassay
limit of detection was found to be 50 pg/mL, with visual detection
at 10 pg/mL based on the appearance of a distinctive wasp waist phenotype
in mice as a subjective metric to judge intoxication (Figure 3B). Lot-to-lot variability of the toxin as well
as individual variation between the mice is known to confound the
mouse bioassay; previous work has shown the mouse bioassay to be sensitive
to approximately 20 pg/mL.8 In contrast,
the SpinDx platform in this assay was sensitive to 0.09 pg/mL, more
than 100-fold more sensitive than the best-reported mouse assay while
using ∼250-fold less sample volume.

Comparison with Conventional
ELISAs
We compared results
of our SpinDx immunoassay for BoNT/A with ELISA protocols established
and used by the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center
(NBACC) and a published protocol by USDA researchers.34 The analysis shows exceptional agreement for BoNT/A detection, y = 1.02x + 5.3886, χ2 = 0.986 (Figure 3C).

No off-Device
Sample Preparation Is Required for Environmental,
Food or Clinical Samples
A key advantage of this approach
is its compatibility with complex sample matrices without requiring
additional sample preparation. We demonstrate detection in a wide
variety of sample matrices in this study, ranging from solids to liquids
to colloids. Figure 4A
shows photographs of the on-disk detection channels following assay
completion with contaminants such as plasma and cells from blood,
caseins from milk, and lipids from peanut butter isolated from the
bead pellet by the density medium. Figure 4B shows results from direct analysis of several important clinical
and food sample matrices. BoNT/A was detected in clinical matrices
such as whole blood, serum, and saliva with minimal matrix interference
compared to the response from buffered systems alone. Food samples
such as milk, canned meat, canned vegetables, juice, and salad dressing
were also compatible with minimal deviation from a linear relationship.
Foods which have low pH and are minimally cooked are most vulnerable
to BoNT/A contamination.45−47 The detection suspension is buffered
by PBS, minimizing the effect of acidic sample matrices such as fruit
and vegetable juices. Note that the two major outbreaks of BoNT/A
intoxication in the United States were traced to canned green beans
and carrot juice.23,48,49 However, while the food-based detection results in Figure 4A were obtained using spiked BoNT/A holotoxin, the
toxin is often found in its natural complex form in environmental
and food samples (and subsequently dissociated following intestinal
absorption). Therefore, we also include dose–response quantification
of hemagglutinin 70 (HA70) – a protein found in the BoNT/A
complex – using HA70-specific monoclonal antibodies (see Figure
S2 in the Supporting Information). New
assays are easily developed upon the SpinDx platform by simple substitution
of sandwich immunoassay affinity reagents.

Figure 4 Matrix independence of
SpinDx measurements. A) Photographs of assay
channels after centrifugation on the SpinDx platform. Background interfering
agents from the sample are clearly separated from the tip of the channel
where the assay is read. (B) Botulinum neurotoxin A immunoassays results
from a wide variety of sample matrices. Good linearity is observed
from all matrices shown. χ2 = 1.48, r2 = 0.997. LoD: 0.09 pg/mL; LoQ: 3.69 pg/mL.

Finally, our diagnostic approach is highly adaptable
as the assay
reagents (i.e., the capture beads and detection antibodies) are disconnected
from the disk architecture, facilitating rapid development of new
assays. Multiplexed assays measuring a number of targets (up to 64
parallel assays using the current disk architecture) may be readily
developed and demonstrated within hours given availability of sandwich
immunoassay affinity reagents.

Conclusion
We
have developed a platform that can serve as a rapid, reliable
detection device for use in public health laboratories and field-laboratories
designated for testing of environmental and clinical samples for botulinum
toxin. We envision SpinDx to be a simple-to-use device in which manual
intervention is limited to introducing the sample into a disk, loading
the disk into a reader, and hitting the start button. It meets the
stringent sensitivity, ease of use, and short assay time requirements
for point-of-care and point-of-incidence applications. Furthermore,
it can perform direct analysis of samples (blood, food, etc.) with
no additional sample prep required. Unique to the platform are signal
enrichment and background suppression elements inherent to the assay
approach enable sensitivities unmatched by conventional approaches.
The proposed device not only meets an urgent unmet need for biodefense
but also provides revolutionary instrumentation and capabilities for
the public health community.
