Mammalian
circadian rhythm is maintained by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)
via an intricate set of neuropeptides and other signaling molecules.
In this work, peptidomic analyses from two times of day were examined
to characterize variation in SCN peptides using three different label-free
quantitation approaches: spectral count, spectra index and SIEVE.
Of the 448 identified peptides, 207 peptides were analyzed by two
label-free methods, spectral count and spectral index. There were
24 peptides with significant (adjusted p-value <
0.01) differential peptide abundances between daytime and nighttime,
including multiple peptides derived from secretogranin II, cocaine
and amphetamine regulated transcript, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin
type 1 inhibitor. Interestingly, more peptides were analyzable and
had significantly different abundances between the two time points
using the spectral count and spectral index methods than with a prior
analysis using the SIEVE method with the same data. The results of
this study reveal the importance of using the appropriate data analysis
approaches for label-free relative quantitation of peptides. The detection
of significant changes in so rich a set of neuropeptides reflects
the dynamic nature of the SCN and the number of influences such as
feeding behavior on circadian rhythm. Using spectral count and spectral
index, peptide level changes are correlated to time of day, suggesting
their key role in circadian function.

==== Body
The circadian
rhythm is a physiological process that occurs in an approximately
24-h cycle controlled by biological clocks. In mammals, the suprachiasmatic
nucleus (SCN), located in the hypothalamus, acts as a “master
clock” that links the other biological clocks to time of day.
Many body functions are synchronized, including energy homeostasis
components such as the sleep-wake cycle, thermoregulation, metabolism,
and feeding behavior.1,2 Disruptions to biological clocks
have been associated with many disorders, such as excessive sleepiness,
depression, and obesity. Research has uncovered a molecular link between
altered circadian rhythms and addiction, with both molecular systems
sharing common signaling pathways.3,4 As just one
example, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is an essential peptide
in the regulation of the biological clock5−7 and plays a
prominent role in morphine treatment and withdrawal-induced acute
hormonal changes in rat.8

The basic
biological clock involves a set of genes that maintains an almost
constant rhythm that is influenced by different stimuli or zeitgebers.
Although light is the important zeitgeber, other stimuli, such as
body temperature, and exercise and feeding schedules, can entrain
the biological clock.1,2 Various neuropeptides, notably
VIP, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), arginine
vasopressin (AVP), and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), are critical
messengers in maintaining SCN synchrony and circadian rhythm in other
tissues.5,9 Recently Atkins et al.10 observed that little SAAS, derived from proprotein convertase
subtilisin/kexin type 1 inhibitor (PCSK1N) prohormone, is also involved
in the SCN light response. Gene and protein expression patterns of
appetite-related prohormones and neuropeptides, such as neuropeptide
Y and Agouti-related protein (AGRP) that stimulate appetite, and cocaine
and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) peptide and pro-opiomelanocortin
(POMC)-derived peptides that reduce appetite, exhibit circadian rhythm.1,2 Rodents with a mutant clock circadian regulator (Clock) gene have abnormal patterns of food intake and metabolic process
neuropeptides such as ghrelin, orexin, and CART.11

Considerable SCN peptide identification work has
been done using indirect approaches, such as in situ hybridization
and immunohistochemistry.12 However, the
specific peptide forms detected by these approaches remain unknown
without extensive validation studies. Alternatively, mass spectrometry
(MS) is a direct approach that allows large numbers of endogenous
peptides, including associated PTMs, to be characterized.13−15 MS can also be used to monitor peptide release, providing a functional
context for detected peptides.10,12,16 A mass spectrometric survey of SCN tissue samples collected 6 h
after lights on led to the identification of 102 endogenous peptides,
including many known neuropeptides associated with the biological
clock.17 This survey also identified shortened
forms of peptides from VIP, GRP, and somatostatin (SST) prohormones
that are unlikely to be distinguished from longer forms by immunohistochemistry,
leading to uncertainty about the actual biologically active forms
of these peptides.12

Quantitative
MS-based proteomics, which can be used to characterize relative peptide
abundance across different conditions, can be undertaken using either
label-based or label-free methods.18−20 Label-based methods
typically involve distinct isotopic labeling of each sample and require
extensive sample preparation and analysis. Several label-free methods
have been shown to have a high correlation (0.99) to relative protein
abundance.18 One method involves identification
and comparison of chromatographic precursor ion intensity from single
stage MS, and another, called spectral count, uses the number of times
that a peptide is identified with tandem MS (MS/MS). Another label-free
alternative, a variation of spectral count, is spectral index, which
is the cumulative intensity of product ions in the MS/MS spectrum
of an identified peptide.21

Previously
Lee et al.22 studied 18 rat SCN peptide
samples collected ∼6 h after lights on (daytime) and ∼6
h after lights off (nighttime). A total of 310 peptides were identified,
with 230 peptides detected at both daytime and nighttime, 49 peptides
detected only at daytime, and 31 peptides only detected at nighttime.
Their results confirmed 63 peptides and 26 related peptides from the
102 hyperconfident peptide list reported in an earlier survey of SCN
daytime peptides.17 The differential peptide
abundance between daytime and nighttime for 173 peptides was assessed
based on label-free integrated precursor ion intensity from chromatographically
aligned spectra (i.e., SIEVE analysis). Twelve peptides were found
to have a significantly differential abundance between daytime and
nighttime (adjusted p-value < 0.05), with a further
14 peptides having a marginally significant differential abundance
(adjusted p-value < 0.1).22

Here, we reanalyze this rich data set22 using the spectral count and spectral index approaches to extract
relative quantitative data from the SCN peptide samples. This allows
a comparison of three label-free approaches for a high dynamic range
neuropeptide application and also provides a much larger and distinct
list of peptides that change in a time-of-day dependent manner. First,
the MS data was annotated independently from the workflow used for
chromatographic alignment using the same annotation criteria for both
new approaches. The spectral count and spectral index for each peptide
were obtained from every sample and analyzed for the differential
abundance between daytime and nighttime. The current analysis reveals
several issues with the SIEVE method and demonstrates that both spectral
count and spectral index provide a richer characterization of differential
peptide abundance. Moreover, this investigation confirms the roles
of PCSK1N peptides and peptides associated with feeding behavior in
the SCN.

Experimental Section
Sample and Data Collection
We used
the data set previously described.22 Briefly,
8–10 week old male Long–Evans rats (LE-BluGill, an inbred
strain from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign)
housed under a 12:12 light-dark cycle, fed ad libitum, were used in
this study. Samples were collected over three days at approximately
6 h after lights on (Zeitgeber time 6, or daytime) and approximately
6 h after lights off (Zeitgeber time 18, or nighttime); each sample
contained individual SCN brain punches pooled from 24 rats (n = 24). We collected 6 samples (2 time points × 3
samples [days]). Overall this resulted in a total of 144 SCN punches
harvested (24 rats × 2 time points × 3 samples [days]).
Each of the 6 biological samples were subjected to multistage peptide
extraction and then separated into 3 equivalent technical replicate
samples, resulting in 18 total samples for analysis (2 time points
× 3 biological samples × 3 technical replicate samples).
The samples were collected in compliance with the National Institutes
of Health guidelines (NIH Publication no. 85-23) using approved vertebrate
animal protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.

The technical replicate samples, alternating between time of collection,
were sequentially run on a 12 T ion trap-based mass spectrometer (LTQ-FT
Ultra, Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) under the same experimental
conditions. Data acquisition included a full scan event (m/z 300–1500), and data-dependent collision-induced
dissociation (CID) ion trap MS/MS scans of the 10 most abundant peaks
from the previous full scans. The MS/MS settings included a 3 m/z isolation width and minimum signal
threshold of 1000 counts.

Peptide Identification
We validated
our prior peptide identifications using the MS/MS data and the Open
Mass Spectrometry Search Algorithm (OMSSA) 2.1.123 with manually curated rat peptide sequences derived from
UniProt24 (15.15 release) that included
known rat neuropeptides. Simulation of neuropeptide-based data has
demonstrated that OMSSA is able to accurately identify neuropeptides
over a wide range of scenarios.25 The search
criteria used the program defaults except for the following settings:
nonspecific enzyme, 0.01 Da peptide m/z tolerance, 0.5 Da MS/MS m/z tolerance,
monoisotopic search using both b and y ions, the instrument precursor charge state was used, charge state
was bounded between 2 and 20, and a minimum charge state of 3 was
used to detect multiply charged products, and required that at least
one of the top six most intense peaks must match an ion from the assigned
sequence. The PTMs permitted were acetylation, amidation, Met oxidation,
pyroglutamylation of Gln/Glu, Ser, Thr, and Tyr phosphorylation, and
N-terminal cleavage of Met. For peptides with more than two PTMs,
only manually verified identified peptides were kept. The identified
peptides were defined as a combination of amino acid sequence and
PTM. The false identification rate (FIR) of peptide identification
was determined by using a separate decoy search using the reversed
sequences since the OMSSA E-value is determined by
database size. Only peptides that surpassed a 5% FIR were used, which
corresponded to a 2.7% false discovery rate (FDR)26 threshold on the parametrically derived OMSSA E-Value.
This implied that the calculated FIR threshold based on the separate
decoy search may be more stringent than initially assumed. We used
the nomenclature as listed for the official mouse and rat nomenclature
guidelines.27

Spectral Count
The peptide spectral count was determined as the number of times
that a specific peptide (defined by sequence and PTMs) was detected
in each technical replicate sample. Under the spectral count definition,
any undetected peptide would have a zero spectral count. However,
a zero count can arise from a peptide being truly absent in a condition,
that is, missing data, or from a failure to detect the presence of
the peptide. Differentiation between missing data and zero counts
for each peptide was determined by comparing technical replicate samples
from the same biological sample. If a peptide was detected in at least
1 technical replicate sample (of the 3 from each biological sample),
then all technical replicate samples from the same biological sample
where the peptide was not detected were recorded as a zero count.
However, if a peptide was not detected in any technical replicate
samples from the associated biological sample, then that peptide was
recorded as undetected in all technical replicate samples of that
biological sample.

Spectral Index
On the basis of Griffin
et al.21 and Wu et al.,28 the peptide spectral index was calculated as the total
number of ions measured in the MS/MS spectra for a peak, divided by
the total number of ions measured in all of the MS/MS spectra, and
divided by the length of the peptide.

Statistical Analysis
The spectral count data on each peptide identified at both time
points was analyzed using a Poisson model where the spectral count
was modeled with collection time (daytime or nighttime) and the biological
samples were nested within the time of collection. Similarly, the
log-transformed spectral index was modeled as time of collection (daytime
or nighttime), and the biological samples were nested within time
of collection under the assumption of normality. An FDR multiple test
adjustment was performed for collection times. These analyses were
conducted using SAS (Statistical Analysis Systems, Cary, NC).

Results
Peptide
Identification
A total of 47 554 spectra (22 832
or 48% at daytime and 24 722 or 52% at nighttime) were identified
with 72.5% of the identified spectra surpassing the 5% FIR threshold.
There was little difference in the proportion of spectra surpassing
the 5% FIR threshold between daytime (72.6%) and nighttime (71.4%)
or individual biological samples at daytime (range 69.6–75.9%)
or nighttime (range 69.1–73%). Identified spectra consisted
of 448 peptides from 24 prohormones (167 peptides) and 167 from other
proteins (281 peptides). The majority of the peptides from prohormones
were derived from the same prohormones. For example, 43, 30, and 16
peptides were derived from secretogranin II (SCG2), PCSK1N, and preproenkephalin
(PENK), respectively. Most of the peptides from the other proteins
were uniquely derived from a single proteins (129 peptides from 129
proteins), with 15 and 33 peptides derived from cytochrome c oxidase,
subunit Va (COX5A), and phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1
(PEBP1), respectively.

The 448 peptides included 167 peptides
derived from prohormones and 281 peptides derived from other proteins
(Supporting Information Table S1). Approximately
half of the peptides (241 peptides) were identified in both sampling
times across multiple biological samples. This resulted in 62 prohormone
peptides and 48 other protein peptides being detected in all daytime
and nighttime biological samples with spectral counts greater than
one. Eighteen peptides were only detected in a single biological sample
for both time points, with only 8 peptides detected once in both time
points. This indicated that most peptides were being identified in
multiple samples across time points rather than an overrepresentation
of a few technical replicate samples.

Many of the 180 peptides
detected at a single time point were in low abundance, with 118 peptides
(74 daytime and 44 nighttime peptides) only detected once. The 129
peptides only detected at daytime included 27 peptides derived from
prohormones and 102 peptides derived from other proteins. The SCG2
prohormone provided the highest number of peptides only detected at
daytime (12 peptides), and the two most frequent peptides were SCG2[184–201]
(64 spectral counts in 5 samples) and SCG2[571–585] (34 spectral
counts in 3 samples). Other peptides only detected at daytime with
more than 10 spectral counts from two biological samples were from
pyruvate kinase (PKM), N-myc downstream regulated gene 2 (NDRG2),
COX5A, diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), and β-actin (ACTB).
The 78 peptides only detected at nighttime were derived from a large
number of proteins that included 27 and 51 peptides from prohormones
and other proteins, respectively. The most frequent peptides were
from VGF nerve growth factor inducible (VGF) (5 peptides) and myelin
basic protein (MBP) (4 peptides). However, peptides from PCSK1N, PENK
(2 peptides), chromogranin B (SCG1), SCG2, and thyrotropin releasing
hormone (TRH) prohormones were detected in more than 1 biological
sample with a spectral count greater than 10.

Most of the peptides
found at a single time point were versions of more frequently detected
peptides, such as single amino acid truncated forms of longer peptides.
There were two peptides with spectral counts over 10 that were detected
only in a single technical sample at either time point. The peptide
SCG2[205–216], which was detected 18 times in a single technical
sample, is a truncated form of three other SCG2 peptides that were
detected at both time points. The most frequent of these peptides
was SCG2[184–216], which was detected 77 and 75 times at daytime
and nighttime, respectively. Similarly, a fragment of the copeptin
derived from vasopressin-neurophysin 2-copeptin (NEU2) prohormone,
NEU2[151–167], which was only detected in a single nighttime
sample (10 spectral counts), is a single amino acid truncated form
of the peptide NEU2[151–168], and was detected in almost all
samples (9 daytime and 7 nighttime).

Analysis of Spectral Count
and Spectral Index
Table 1 summarizes
the different analyses provided in Supporting
Information Table S1 for all peptides analyzed by spectral
count and spectral index, including 207 unanalyzed peptides because
of their detection at a single time point, and 26 peptides unanalyzed
by spectral index. There were 19 peptides significant (adjusted p-value < 0.001) for both spectral count and spectral
index and, at a less stringent threshold (adjusted p-value < 0.01), a further 5 peptides significant for both analyses.
This increased to a total of 50 peptides significant for both spectral
count and spectral index at a 10% adjusted threshold. Only 4 peptides
were significant for spectral count (adjusted p-value
< 0.01) but nonsignificant for spectral index. There were 35 peptides
significant for only spectral index (adjusted p-value
< 0.01) but not for spectral count. There were 105 peptides nonsignificant
(adjusted p-value > 0.1) in either analysis.

There were 24 peptides from
10 prohormones and 7 other proteins with significantly differential
abundance between daytime and nighttime at an adjusted p-value of < 0.01 for both spectral count and spectral index (Table 2). The most peptides came from SCG2 (3 peptides),
CART prepropeptide (CARTPT) (3 peptides), PEBP1 (2 peptides), peroxiredoxin
5 (PRDX5) (2 peptides), and PCSK1N (2 peptides). Most of the peptides
from prohormones (11 peptides) were significantly more abundant at
nighttime than daytime. For example, PCSK1N peptides showed more peptides
that were more abundant at nighttime than daytime (Figure 1). In contrast, all of the peptides from other proteins,
except for 1 peptide, were more abundant at daytime than nighttime.
Except for the CARTPT-derived peptides, all peptides from the same
prohormone or protein had similar abundance patterns. Only SCG2[198–216],
which was significant for both spectral count (adjusted p-value < 0.05) and spectral index (adjusted p-value < 0.001), had a different direction of the relative abundance
between the spectral count and spectral index analyses (Figure 2). This peptide was only detected in a single daytime
technical replicate sample and 5 nighttime samples, such that the
average ion intensity was higher in the daytime sample than the nighttime
samples.

and negative values indicate peptides less abundant at daytime than

The 5 peptides that were only
significant (adjusted p-value < 0.01) for spectral
count were derived from 2 prohormones and 3 proteins. The 47 peptides
that were only significant for spectral index were from 10 prohormones
and 17 proteins. The most frequent prohormones were PCSK1N (5 peptides
from the prohormone), PENK (4 peptides), and SCG2 (3 peptides); the
most frequent proteins were PEBP1 (8 peptides) and COX5A (3 peptides).
In contrast to the spectral count analyses, the 26 peptides unanalyzed
for spectral index included a ribosomal protein S21 (RS21) peptide
(RS21[74–83]) and PENK[85–96], which were marginally
significant for spectral count. Both of these peptides were highly
frequent at daytime (spectral count of 40 and 15, respectively) but
were only detected once at nighttime. However, VGF[587–600],
which was detected 21 times at daytime and 3 times at nighttime, was
not significant for either analysis. The few peptides only significant
for spectral count implies that peptides with significant differential
abundance, as determined by spectral count, are also differentially
abundant with spectral index. This suggests that spectral index is
more sensitive than spectral count for infrequently observed peptides.

Influence of PTMs
The majority (72.58%) of peptides identified
had no PTMs; of those peptides with PTMs, phosphorylation (10.56%)
and acetylation (8.31%) were the most common. There were 425 unique
peptide sequences, with only 23 peptides having two PTMs. There were
8 peptide sequences from 5 prohormones (CARTPT, POMC, PENK, SCG1,
and TRH) and 1 protein (PEBP1) where at least the modified or unmodified
form was significant for either spectral count or spectral index.
Except for unmodified SCG1[597–611], all peptides were found
in at least 2 biological samples per time point. In all cases, both
forms exhibited the same direction of difference, implying that the
modification process was not related to the peptide abundance. This
included the phosphorylated forms of CARTPT[37–54] (ALDIYSAVDDAS[phos]HEKELP)
and CARTPT[37–55] (ALDIYSAVDDAS[phos]HEKELPR), which differed
by an N-terminal Arg. The CARTPT[37–54] peptide was significantly
more abundant for both spectral count and spectral index than the
CARTPT[37–55] peptide. Different modifications of three peptide
sequences showed differential sequences between spectral count and
spectral index. Both the unmodified POMC[141–162] peptide and
phosphorylated POMC[141–162] peptide (RPVKVYPNVAENES[phos]AEAFPLEF)
were found in at least 17 samples and had significant differential
abundance for spectral index (adjusted p-value <
0.01). The phosphorylated POMC[141–162] was nonsignificant
for spectral count but the unmodified peptide was slightly significant
(adjusted p-value < 0.05). A similar trend was
observed with pyroglutamated PEBP1[170–187] ([pyro]QAEWDDSVPKLHDQLAGK)
peptide, where the pyroglutamated peptide was significant for both
spectral count and spectral index (adjusted p-value
< 0.01), but the unmodified peptide was only significant for spectral
index. However, sampling variation may have limited any differences
because the unmodified PEBP1[170–187] peptide was only detected
in 4 daytime and 5 nighttime technical replicate samples. The unmodified
SCG1[597–611] peptide sequence was only detected in 1 spectral
index daytime sample, whereas the pyroglutamated SCG1[597–611]
([pyro]QYDDGVAELDQLLHY) was detected in all 18 spectral index samples.
This differential abundance associated with the PTMs may reflect a
biologically related, time-dependent modification of these peptides.

Discussion
Perhaps not surprisingly, of the 448 peptides
reported in this study, the vast majority (310 peptides) were also
reported in our previous study using SIEVE.22 The remaining 138 peptides had low abundance, including 118 peptides
with a single spectral count, which were not analyzed in the current
work. There were 164 peptides analyzed in both studies, 77 peptides
only analyzed in this study, and 9 peptides only analyzed in the prior
study. Most of the differences in the number of peptides analyzed
were attributed to the 1 × 10–3 OMSSA E-value
criterion used in the prior study compared to the 5% FIR used in this
study. However, many of the peptides missing in the prior study had
a spectral count of at least 20, and 11 of these peptides were present
in all 18 technical replicate samples. This indicates a fundamental
failure of the general SIEVE method to detect and analyze many of
the peptides, even though many peptides had multiple annotated MS/MS
spectra from multiple technical replicate samples. We had previously
observed that peptides with long elution times were problematic for
the automatic alignment of SIEVE,22 which
may have also been a contributing factor to the differences in peptides
analyzed between the two studies.

One of the more interesting
outcomes is the lack of agreement between the results of the prior
SIEVE analysis and the spectral count and index analyses performed
in the current study for the 164 peptides analyzed in both efforts.
Only 7 peptides, CARTPT[37–54], phosphorylated CARTPT[37–54],
a secretogranin III (SCG3) fragment (SCG3[38–57]), TRH[178–199],
a vimentin (VIME) fragment (VIME[444–466]), SCG2[340–356],
and PENK[263–269], were found to be significant (adjusted p-value < 0.1) using all three methods. However, 24 peptides
that were marginally significant for both spectral count and spectral
index were nonsignificant in the SIEVE analysis; 54 peptides were
nonsignificant for all three methods. But there were 6 peptides significant
in the SIEVE analysis that there were nonsignificant for both spectral
count and spectral index. Differential peptide detection was not a
contributing factor because 3 of these peptides, an adenylate cyclase
activating polypeptide 1 (ADCYAP1) fragment (ADCYAP1 [111–128]),
SCG1[435–450], and PCSK1N[44–59], were detected in all
18 technical replicate samples with similar average spectral counts
and spectral indexes between daytime and nighttime. A possible reason
is the asymmetrical sensitivity of Fisher’s method combined
probability test, such that a high significance in one frame will
dominate the test, even though there is no overall difference between
conditions. In addition, there were 9 peptides that were marginally
significant for both the spectral index and the SIEVE analysis but
not for the spectral count. This may be because the spectral index
and SIEVE analyses both involve ion intensities from different levels
and could support the differential abundance of those 9 peptides.

A potential advantage of the SIEVE method is that all frames can
be analyzed for a peptide, provided that at least one frame has an
annotated peptide. This was evident by the vast majority of the frames
having 18 technical replicate samples with integrated peak intensities
greater than zero. As a result, the SIEVE analysis provided some quantitation
of the differences between daytime and nighttime for some of the peptides
that could not be analyzed by the spectral methods. Sixteen and 14
peptides that were only detected at daytime and nighttime, respectively,
were analyzed by SIEVE, but could not be analyzed in this study. A
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1 (HMCS1) fragment, HMCS1[159–179],
that was only detected in a single nighttime technical replicate sample,
was marginally significant (adjusted p-value <
0.1) in the SIEVE analysis. This indicates that there is no benefit
from the SIEVE analysis for peptides only detected in one condition.

Unlike the analysis of the overall peptide abundance between time
points provided by the spectral count method, the SIEVE method only
provides the analysis of differential peptide abundance within a frame.
SIEVE ignores variations between frames and requires similar differential
peptide abundances across frames in order to provide a reliable estimate
of overall peptide abundance. An important underlying assumption of
the SIEVE method is that integrated intensity is only attributed to
one peptide. When more than one peptide is annotated within a frame,
the integrated intensity is replicated for each identified peptide
and the analysis ignores the presence of other peptides annotated
in the same frame. Consequently, the integrated intensity will be
overestimated when more than one peptide is present in the frame.
In the previous study,22 96%, 3%, and 1%
of frames were assigned to 1, 2, and 4 peptides, respectively, suggesting
that any bias due to multiple peptides would be small for most peptides.
This ignores any bias resulting from the presence of chimeric spectra,
where two or more peptides are present in the same MS/MS spectrum,
since OMSSA is generally able to detect only one of the peptides present
in simulated spectra.25

This study
confirms the presence of a number of different neuropeptides in the
SCN17,22 and highlights limitations in our knowledge
of the role many of these peptides play in SCN function. While some
detected peptides are processed from prohormones corresponding to
known and predicted cleavage sites, other peptides may be degradation
products of larger peptides or proteins, and, potentially new bioactive
peptides. Evaluation of the differences between an expected full-length
peptide and a shorter, potentially degraded form at the two time points
studied, suggests a circadian role for that peptide. Specific examples
of known peptides and proteins that were detected in the current study
are discussed below.

Several peptides from ADCYAP1 and VIP prohormones,
which are associated with SCN synchronization and light entrainment,5,6 were detected. The ADCYAP1[111–128] peptide, a truncated
form of the PACAP-related peptide, was detected in
all daytime and nighttime samples but showed no difference in spectral
count or spectral index between daytime and nighttime. A few peptides
from the C-terminal region of the VIP prohormone and a shortened form
of the intestinal peptide PHI-27 region of VIP were detected. Most
of the peptides from the VIP prohormone were irregularly detected
except for VIP[156–169] peptide from the VIP C-terminal region,
which was detected in all samples. While VIP[156–169] was frequent
at both daytime and nighttime, it had significantly (adjusted p-value < 0.001) higher abundance at nighttime than daytime.
This pattern indirectly supports the increased expression of the VIP
peptides at nighttime compared to daytime6 because this terminal peptide is produced by one of the cleavages
necessary to produce the full length VIP[125–152]. The automatic
annotation failed to identify short VIP[125–137] (HSDAVFTDNYTRL),
which was observed to be more abundant at nighttime compared to daytime
using manual integration.22 Only the terminal
VIP propeptide without the C-terminal lysine was detected in all technical
replicate samples in only 2 nighttime samples. This peptide was significantly
higher at nighttime than daytime for spectral index, with a similar
but nonsignificant tendency for spectral count.

PCSK1N, a potent
inhibitor of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 and a regulator
of feeding behavior, body weight and composition,29−31 was recently
identified as having a role in SCN function.10,16 Here we identified 30 PCSK1N peptides that are mapped into three
known regions: the SAAS region (6 peptides including the known big
and little SAAS peptides), PEN-LEN region (8 peptides including the
known PEN, PEN-20 and big LEN peptides), and the intermediate GAV-containing
region (16 peptides). The SAAS region consists of big SAAS, little
SAAS, and 4 truncated little SAAS peptides, which were detected in
17 samples. Most of the peptides detected by spectral count were little
SAAS (average 51 spectral counts per sample) and a previously truncated
little SAAS peptide (average 26 spectral counts per sample).17,32,33 Although big SAAS was marginally
significant for both spectral count and spectral index (adjusted p-value < 0.05), little SAAS
exhibited a significantly higher spectral index at
nighttime compared to daytime. The PEN-LEN region mainly consisted
of the PEN peptide (averaged spectral count of 80 and 109 at daytime
and nighttime, respectively) that was significantly more abundant
at nighttime than daytime for both spectral count and spectral index.
Similar to mouse studies31,34−36 but in contrast to Morgan et al.,30 big
LEN was detected in 3 daytime samples and 1 nighttime sample. The
GAV-containing region, which involves the PCSK1N region between the
SAAS and PEN-LEN regions, was detected by Sayah et al.37 Although the full-length GAV (PCSK1N[62–89])
was not detected here, 5 truncated GAV peptides were detected. The
truncated GAV peptide PCSK1N[62–79] was significantly more
abundant at daytime than nighttime, even though it was only detected
in 6 daytime samples and 9 nighttime samples. A total of 9 peptides,
including the previously reported PCSK1N[111–143],32 were detected from the middle of this region.
The PCSK1N[121–143] peptide was detected in all 18 samples
but was only significantly more abundant at nighttime than daytime
for spectral index. The GAV-containing region contains no known bioactive
peptides and lacks consistent NeuroPred-predicted38 cleavage sites across models, suggesting that the peptides
from the GAV-containing region identified in this study may not be
formed during intracellular processing of the prohormone.

Peptides
from CARTPT, POMC, SCG1, SCG2, tachykinin 1 (TKN1), tachykinin 2 (TKNK),
VGF, prodynorphin (PDYN), and PENK prohormones that are known or suspected
to influence feeding behavior and energy homeostasis were found to
be significant using both spectral count and spectral index. This
study is the first to provide direct evidence for diurnal variation
of these peptides. A review of prior studies of these prohormones,
and known peptides produced from these prohormones, provides evidence
to support the circadian rhythm or diurnal variation, and the results
of our current analyses. Previous studies have shown that CARTPT appears
to have a circadian rhythm that is influenced by glucocorticoids and
food intake. Administration of CARTPT[55–102] was able to promote
wakefulness depending on dosage.39 The
CARTPT gene structure contains Clock-responsive E-box
elements such that mice with a mutant Clock gene
have significantly lower expression levels of CART than wild-type
mice.40 The significant CARTPT-derived
peptides were two previously unreported subsequences of the known
CARTPT[1–52] peptide corresponding to cleavages at Arg sites
of the ’long’ CARTPT isoform that produces CARTPT[55–102]
peptide. Both of the identified peptides were predicted to be cleaved
from the CARTPT[1–52] peptide by NeuroPred. Additional evidence
that CARTPT[1–52] is further cleaved is that Faith et al.32 detected the N-terminal region of CARTPT[1–52],
which was not detected here, and Lee et al.17 identified CARTPT[37–55]. Both unmodified and phosphorylated
forms of CARTPT[37–54] and CARTPT[37–55] were detected
in all 18 samples. This suggests that some of the different abundances
between peptides may be related to sampling or the presence of phosphorylation.
The higher spectral count and index of CARTPT[37–54] at nighttime
compared to daytime was consistent with the differences reported by
Vicentic et al.41−43 with the CARTPT[55–102] and CARTPT[62–102]
peptides.

The cleavage of corticotropin POMC peptide results
in corticotropin-like intermediary peptide, POMC[141–162],
which was detected, and alpha-MSH, which was undetected; both are
known to exhibit diurnal variation. The enkephalins are well-known
to have a diurnal variation that is modifiable by feeding.44 Diurnal variation of TRH and TRH-like peptide
levels in different regions of the rat brain, including the hypothalamus,
have been reported.45 The CARTPT and POMC
prohormones are known to be coexpressed46 and both are regulated by leptin.47 Gene
expression of Trh is regulated by leptin48,49 and influenced by CART.50

Cleavage
of TKN1 produces both substance P, a well-known peptide associated
with circadian rhythm, and neurokinin A. Both peptides are released
together51 and are expressed together.52 The fragment of TKN1 prohormone is mostly likely
a secondary product of the cleavage of the larger neuropeptide K that
produces neurokinin A. The terminal region of TKNK was also detected,
which results from one of the cleavages necessary to produce neurokinin
B. Neurokinin B is also able to bind to all the three tachykinin receptors,52 although the known role for reproductive regulation
related to gonadotropin release53 suggests
an alternative pathway. The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
pathway is known to be involved with the SCN and circadian rhythm.54

The detected dynorphin peptide fragment,
PDYN[211–218], results from the cleavage of dynorphin A(1–17)
peptide (PDYN[202–218]) to form dynorphin A (1–8) peptide
(PDYN[202–209]). Circadian differences in the gene expression
levels of PDYN and PENK have been reported in the mouse striatum.55 Somewhat similar to the simultaneous detection
of peptides related to neurokinin-B and dynorphin, dynorphin is also
colocalized with neurokinin-B and kisspeptin in the arcuate nucleus.56 This observation may also suggest a relationship
with the circadian rhythm of the GnRH pathway. Differences between
daytime and nighttime for SCG1 gene expression have been reported
in the rat pineal gland.57 Gene expression
of VGF in the SCN has been associated with circadian rhythm58 and VGF expression is regulated by light in
the SCN.59

Although little is known
about the role of SCG2 peptides, they have been associated with various
processes including reproduction, dopamine release, and feeding.60 SCG2 is highly expressed in the SCN and the
importance of SCG2 in the SCN was reinforced by the successful inclusion
of the SCG2 promoter in a tetracycline transactivator system that
regulated Clock expression.61 The 43 SCG2 peptides were grouped into eight distinct regions that
were composed of between 2 to 12 peptides per region, including the
regions containing the secretoneurin (SCG2[184–216]) and manserin
(SCG2[529–568]) peptides. Little experimental evidence exists
for SCG2 peptides but these regions corresponded to NeuroPred-predicted
cleavage sites using models trained on mammalian data. Identification
variability resulted in only 16 peptides being present in all sample
periods, indicating that many peptides may be degradation products.
Various peptides from the same region exhibited opposite significant
differential abundances between daytime and nighttime, suggesting
that SCG2 may not be associated with circadian rhythm. The distribution
and expression of secretoneurin is similar to substance P and Leu-enkephalin
and associated dopamine release and dynorphin B peptides that have
circadian rhythm.62 SCG2 expression has
a diurnal rhythm in the rat pineal gland57,63 that was not apparent in this study due to the specific sample times.

Several peptides from nonprohormone proteins showed significant
differential abundance between daytime and nighttime using both spectral
count and spectral index. There were several proteins, ATP synthase,
ATP5i, NME/NM23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase 2 (NME2), PEBP1, and
serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SFRS2), associated with or
involving ATP and mitochondrial cytochrome subunits. While there are
no prior reports of an association of these proteins with circadian
rhythm, global redox state was recently shown to undergo circadian
oscillations in rat and mouse SCN, with a reduced state maximal at
mid-day,64 suggesting a role for proteins
involved in redox state in circadian rhythm.

Conclusions
Three
label-free approaches have been used to determine relative changes
in peptide abundances from the same chemically complex and high dynamic
range neuropeptide-rich data set. More specifically, spectral count
and spectral index methods were compared to a prior SIEVE analysis.
We found that SIEVE did not provide additional insights when peptides
were identified in samples from only one condition, and those results
were found to be inconsistent with the results using the spectral
count and spectral index methods. Further, there are important statistical
limitations that make it difficult to recommend SIEVE analysis for
this type of data set. The spectral count and spectral index methods
provided similar outcomes to each other, with spectral count being
more conservative than spectral index. However, the spectral index
method may suggest spurious peptides as having significant changes
compared to the spectral count method when peptides are infrequently
detected across samples. This study certainly demonstrates the advantages
of using multiple label-free approaches to extract the most meaningful
information possible from a data set.

While high resolution
MS had been used to identify a surprisingly rich neuropeptide complement
in the SCN, a functional context has been missing. The fact that many
of these peptides change levels as a function of time of day suggests
that multiple peptides are likely to have roles related to timekeeping,
feeding or energy homeostasis. This analysis confirmed the importance
of peptides derived from PCSK1N in SCN function. The differential
abundance of numerous peptides from prohormones, notably CARTPT and
PENK, further confirms the strong interrelationship between circadian
rhythm, and feeding and energy homeostasis. These relationships, and
the roles that specific peptides play in them, provide additional
pathways to target for pharmaceutical intervention to correct altered
circadian rhythms in various disorders and should lead to an improved
understanding of the link between circadian rhythm, mood disorders
and drug addiction.
