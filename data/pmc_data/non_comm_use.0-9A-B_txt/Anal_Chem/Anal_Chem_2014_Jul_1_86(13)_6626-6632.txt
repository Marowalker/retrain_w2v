Low
molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are heterogeneous, polydisperse,
and highly negatively charged mixtures of glycosaminoglycan chains
prescribed as anticoagulants. The detailed characterization of LMWH
is important for the drug quality assurance and for new drug research
and development. In this study, online hydrophilic interaction chromatography
(HILIC) Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) was applied to
analyze the oligosaccharide fragments of LMWHs generated by heparin
lyase II digestion. More than 40 oligosaccharide fragments of LMWH
were quantified and used to compare LMWHs prepared by three different
manufacturers. The quantified fragment structures included unsaturated
disaccharides/oligosaccharides arising from the prominent repeating
units of these LMWHs, 3-O-sulfo containing tetrasaccharides
arising from their antithrombin III binding sites, 1,6-anhydro ring-containing
oligosaccharides formed during their manufacture, saturated uronic
acid oligosaccharides coming from some chain nonreducing ends, and
oxidized linkage region oligosaccharides coming from some chain reducing
ends. This bottom-up approach provides rich detailed structural analysis
and quantitative information with high accuracy and reproducibility.
When combined with the top-down approach, HILIC LC-FTMS based analysis
should be suitable for the advanced quality control and quality assurance
in LMWH production.

==== Body
Heparin is a complex sulfated
polysaccharide, known as a glycosaminoglycan, which is widely used
as a clinical anticoagulant.1 Heparin,
on average, is composed of ∼25 disaccharide repeating units
and has an average molecular weight of ∼16 000 Da. Its
major repeating disaccharide unit is trisulfated, (→4) α-L-IdoA2S
(1→4) α-D-GlcNS6S (1→), where IdoA is iduronic
acid, GlcN is glucosamine, and S is sulfo.1,2 In
addition to these residues, heparin contains glucuronic acid (GlcA)
and N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) residues having
varying numbers of O-sulfo groups.2,3 Heparin
also contains pentasaccharide sequences, with a central 3-O-sulfo group-containing GlcN residue, which are the primary
structures responsible for heparin binding to antithrombin III (AT),
resulting in inhibition of blood coagulation.4 Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), derived from heparin by controlled
chemical or enzymatic depolymerization,5,6 have a primary
structure similar to heparin but an average molecular weight of ∼4000
to ∼8000 Da, corresponding to ∼6 to ∼12 disaccharide
units. Several types of LMWHs are in clinical use. The current study
focuses on the most widely used LMWH, enoxaparin, which is prepared
through the chemical esterification of heparin’s uronic acid
carboxyl groups followed by base treatment leading to β-eliminative
cleavage and ester hydrolysis.5 This chemical
method used in the manufacturing of enoxaparin can modify its structure,
not only changing the polydispersity and sequence heterogeneity of
LMWH but also introducing unnatural saccharide residues, such as unsaturated
uronic acid residues at the nonreducing ends and unnatural 1,6-anhydro
ring structures at the reducing ends of some of the enoxaparin’s
chains.7,8

A number of methods, including top-down
and bottom-up approaches, has been applied for the structural characterization
of enoxaparin sodium. In the top-down approach, the intact oligosaccharide
chains are directly analyzed without further depolymerization. Nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy plays a very important role
in the structural identification of intact chains,9,35 and
two-dimensional (2D) NMR can be used to identify LMWH type and to
calculate their monosaccharide composition.10 Nonetheless, milligram amounts of pure samples are needed to acquire
the data for NMR, and some relatively minor residues cannot be easily
detected by NMR. Mass spectrometry is a particularly useful technique
for the structural characterization of LMWHs, providing both high
sensitivity and high resolution. Powerful separation techniques,35 particularly when combined with MS, can enhance
the structural identification of heterogeneous and polydisperse LMWHs.
Reversed-phase ion-pairing liquid chromatography (RPIP)-ESI-MS has
been widely applied to the analysis of glycosaminoglycan-derived oligosaccharides,11−13,36 and Chi et al.14 has recently utilized this method to profile the intact
LMWHs and identify more than 200 intact components in enoxaparin sodium.
Ultraperformance size exclusion chromatography/electrospray quadruple
time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (UPSEC/Q-TOF-MS) has also been applied
to identify more than 70 intact components in enoxaparin sodium, including
oligosaccharides with unnatural structures, such as 1,6-anhydro rings,
and saturated uronic acid residues and odd-numbered oligosaccharides
at the nonreducing end.15 Our group has
elucidated and semiquantified nearly 300 intact chains in LMWHs (made
up of a smaller number of glycosidically linked disaccharide and oligosaccharide
components) using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)-Fourier
transform-(FT) electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS).16

In bottom-up approaches, oligosaccharides
are typically prepared through the digestion of LMWH with heparin
lyases (I, II, and/or III) and then analyzed by strong anion exchange
chromatography (SAX), RPIP chromatography, and capillary electrophoresis
(CE) and then detected by their UV absorbance or through MS.17−22,36,42 Disaccharide compositional analysis is one of the primary ways to
characterize LMWH composition.19,20,42 In addition to disaccharides, oligosaccharides are formed that include
3-O-sulfo group-containing tetrasaccharides,23 1,6-anhydro ring-containing oligosaccharides,
oligosaccharides with a saturated uronic acid residue, and oligosaccharides
with an odd number of saccharide units, arising from a nonreducing
end of the chain.15 Many of the reported
structures can be related to the activity and pharmacology of LMWHs.8,24,25 Therefore, there is an urgent
need to develop improved bottom-up methods to profile all these oligosaccharides.

In this paper, we report a rapid analytical method for the characterization
of enoxaparin-type LMWHs using a bottom-up approach. This method relies
on HILIC LC-Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) analysis combined
with heparin lyase II digestion. Data analysis utilizes a newly developed
bioinformatics software package, GlycReSoft.29 The oligosaccharides (dp2 to dp6) generated from LMWHs prepared
by three different manufacturers are compared.

Experimental Section
Materials
LMWHs, of enoxaparin sodium from Sanofi-Aventis (Lovenox) and enoxaparin
sodium from Sandoz (a generic version of Lovenox), were obtained from
hospital pharmacies (3 lots of each) and were freeze-dried prior to
analysis. A bulk-lyophilized LMWH prepared using a process similar
to that used to prepare enoxaparin sodium was a gift from Celsus Laboratories
Inc. (Cincinnati, Ohio). E. coli expression and purification
of the recombinant F. heparinum heparin lyase II
(EC# 4.2.2.X) was performed in our laboratory as described.26 Acetonitrile, ammonium acetate, and water were
of HPLC grade (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).

Enzymatic Digestion of
LMWHs
Three lots of desalted LMWH samples (100 μg)
from each manufacturer were dissolved in 100 μL of distilled
water and completely digested by heparin lyase II (20 mU) at 35 °C
for 2 h (longer digestion times of up to 12 h gave similar results).
Aliquots were immediately heated in a 100 °C water bath to stop
the reaction and were then spun down at 12 000 rpm for 5 min;
supernatants were used directly for LC-MS analysis.

HILIC LC ESI-LTQ-Orbitrap-FTMS
Analysis of Digested LMWHs
A Luna HILIC column (2.0 ×
50 mm, 200 Å, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) was used to separate
the LMWHs. Mobile phase A was 5 mM ammonium acetate prepared with
HPLC grade water. Mobile B was 5 mM ammonium acetate prepared in 98%
HPLC grade acetonitrile with 2% of HPLC grade water. The gradient
was used from 5% A to 70% A in 7 min then reset to 5% A at a flow
rate of 250 μL/min. The LC column was directly connected online
to the standard ESI source of LTQ-Orbitrap XL FT MS (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, San-Jose, CA). The source parameters for FTMS detection
were optimized using Arixtra (a synthetic ultra LMWH from Sanofi-Aventis,
Paris, France) to minimize the insource fragmentation and sulfate
loss and maximize the signal/noise in the negative-ion mode. The optimized
parameters, used to prevent in-source fragmentation, included a spray
voltage of 4.2 kV, a capillary voltage of −40 V, a tube lens
voltage of −50 V, a capillary temperature of 275 °C, a
sheath flow rate of 30 L/min, and an auxiliary gas flow rate of 6
L/min. External calibration of mass spectra routinely produced a mass
accuracy of better than 3 ppm. All FT mass spectra were acquired at
a resolution 60 000 with 200–2000 Da mass range.

Bioinformatics
Charge deconvolution was autoprocessed by DeconTools software (web
source from PNNL at http://omics.pnl.gov/). LMWH structural assignment was done by either manual or automatic
processing using GlycReSoft 1.0 software developed at Boston University
(http://code.google.com/p/glycresoft/downloads/list).29 For automatic processing, GlycReSoft 1.0 parameters
were set as Minimum Abundance, 1.0; Minimum Number of Scans, 1; Molecular
Weight Lower Boundary, 200 Da; Molecular Weight Upper Boundary, 6000
Da; Mass Shift, ammonium; Match Error (E_M), 5.0 ppm; Grouping Error
(E_G), 80 ppm; Adduct Tolerance (E_A), 5.0 ppm. For LMWH digested
components identification, the theoretical database was generated
by GlycReSoft 1.0 for different structures. All of the quantitative
data were normalized to the total identified oligosaccharides peak
area (in the format of percentage, %).

Results and Discussion
Depolymerization
of LMWHs Using Heparin Lyase II
LMWHs, such as enoxaparin
sodium, are more complicated in structure than the precursor heparin
since their chemical fractionation introduces new structural artifacts.5,6 These chemical processes differ from manufacturer-to-manufacturer
and can uniquely modify the structure of each LMWH. The resulting
products are polydisperse mixtures of chains, that while retaining
most of heparin’s natural structure also contain unnatural,
unsaturated uronate residues at the nonreducing ends of some of their
chains and unnatural 1,6-anhydro ring structures at the reducing ends
of some of their chains. The characterization of the detailed structural
information requires a bottom-up approach in LMWH analysis. Enzymes
are the crucial tool for achieving such bottom-up analyses of LMWHs.
Heparin lyases are eliminases that act on the glycosidic linkage between
IdoA or GlcA and GlcN residues affording disaccharide and oligosaccharide
products having an unsaturated uronic acid residue (ΔUA) at
their nonreducing ends. Heparin lyase II is a heparinase with broad
specificity that acts at linkages containing either (1 → 4)-α-L-IdoA
or (1 → 4)-β-D-GlcA residues and accommodates many different
sulfation patterns in these polysaccharides.27,28 Oligosaccharides of heparins generated by digestion of heparin lyase
II have been mapped.23 Tetrasaccharides
containing 3-O-sulfo groups are observed in the products
of heparin digested by heparin lyase II.38 Therefore, we selected heparin lyase II and developed a quick and
exhaustive digestion method to prepare oligosaccharides from LMWH
samples for bottom-up analysis.

HILIC LC ESI-LTQ-Orbitrap-FTMS
Analysis of Digested Products of LMWHs
Luna-HILIC separation
is based on analyte polarity and affords good separation of glycans.16 The high-resolution and high mass accuracy of
ESI-FTMS make this method suitable for glycan analysis. HILIC-ESI-FTMS
proved to be a powerful platform in the top-down approach with the
high resolution separation and analysis of intact LMWH chains.16 We elucidated and semiquantified nearly 300
of oligosaccharide chains of LMWH samples using this method.16 Here, a similar method was applied in the bottom-up
approach to characterize disaccharides and oligosaccharides prepared
from LMWHs using heparin lyase II, except HILIC separation relied
on a shorter column (5 cm), greatly reducing the analytical run time,
to 7 min. The total ion chromatograms (TIC) of digested LMWH (in triplicate)
using HILIC-ESI-FTMS are shown in Figure 1A,
and the typical unsaturated oligosaccharide quantification comparison
after digestion of LMWHs is shown in Figure 1B. Figure 1A demonstrates excellent run-to-run
reproducibility of this method and the separation of different oligosaccharides.
The major TIC peaks observed in Figure 1A were
disaccharides and tetrasaccharides (degree of polymerization (dp)2
and (dp)4). Nevertheless, the mass spectrum for each peak was still
too complex to be completely interpreted, as each peak contained a
mixture of multiple components having various sequences and degrees
of sulfation. Therefore, the raw data from the HILIC LC-FTMS was deconvoluted
using Decon Tools, and then, the output of Decon Tools was processed
by GlycResoft to generate matching structures and to provide quantitative
information.29 Quantitative results on
the major unsaturated oligosaccharide of three different LMWHs samples
are shown in Figure 1B. Approximately 23 unsatutated
oligosaccharide structures were matched by GlycResoft including 6
disaccharides, 4 trisaccharides, 11 tetrasaccharides, and 2 pentasaccharides
in Figure 1A. The majority of these oligosaccharides
were even-numbered, although odd-numbered oligosaccharides were also
identified. As expected, the trisulfated disaccharide, corresponding
to ΔUA2S-GlcNS6S, was the major component in each sample.

oligosaccharides.

Tetrasaccharides with
3-O-sulfo groups, generated by heparin lyase II digestion,
derived from heparin’s AT-binding sites, can be applied to
evaluate the anticoagulant activity of each LMWH.23,24 Four major 3-O-sulfated tetrasaccharides were reported
previously and are also detected in these LMWH samples. Their extracted
ion chromatograms (EICs) and high-resolution FTMS spectrum examples
are shown in Figure 2. Ions of m/z 477.034 (ΔUA-GlcNAc6S-GlcA-GlcNS3S), m/z 517.013 (ΔUA-GlcNAc6S-GlcA-GlcNS3S6S), m/z 535.985 (ΔUA-GlcNS6S-GlcA-GlcNS3S6S),
and m/z 437.055 (ΔUA-GlcNAc-GlcA-GlcNS3S)
correspond to the major 3-O-sulfo group-containing
tetrasaccharides after heparin lyase II digestion. Eight additional
low abundant tetrasaccharides were also profiled and quantified (Figure 1B). On the basis of the known specificity heparin
lyase II, these digestion-resistant tetrasaccharides may represent
putative 3-O-sulfo group-containing structures. However,
because of their low abundance and difficulties in separating these
tetrasaccharides from one another, their structures could not be confirmed
by NMR. Thus, we cannot definitively establish that all these tetrasaccharides
contain 3-O-sufate groups.

Figure 2 Example of extracted
ion chromatograms (EICs) and high resolution mass spectrogram of four
major 3-O-sulfo group-containing tetrasaccharides
derived from LMWHs on heparin lyase II treatment.

Terminal 1,6-anhydro-amino sugars, formed during the β-eliminative
cleavage of heparin in the manufacturing process, are typical structural
moieties found within LMWHs. These 1,6-anhydro-amino residues can
reportedly decrease the anticoagulant activity of LMWHs.8 Since anhydo-components correspond to the loss
of additional water, oligosaccharides of compositions [ΔHexA
= 0, HexA, GlcN, Ac, SO3] and [ΔHexA = 1, HexA, GlcN,
Ac, SO3] were added to our database to allow their identification.
By matching the results generated to the GlycoResoft database, the
1,6-anhydro oligosaccharides were identified and quantified in all
three of the LMWHs being studied (Figure 3A).
On the basis of these results, all of the three different LMWH products
examined afforded similar profiles of the 1,6-anhydro-components on
heparin lyase II treatment. Some minor differences were observed in
the distribution of the 1,6-anhydro oligosaccharides between the dp2
and dp4 fractions formed from the three LMWH products being studied.

comparison of identified rare heparin oligosaccharides from three
commercialized LMWH products digested by heparin lyase II. (A) Quantitative
comparison of anhydro oligosaccharides identified in three LMWHs;
(B) quantitative comparison of nonreducing end oligosaccharides identified
in three LMWHs; (C) quantitative comparison of linkage region oligosaccharides
identified in three LMWHs.

Most of the LMWH chains contain 4,5-unsaturated uronic acid
residues at the nonreducing end. Minor oligosaccharide structures,
with saturated uronic acid residues at their nonreducing end are present
in chains of LMWH that had been derived from the original nonreducing
end of the parent heparin. These saturated oligosaccharide products
were also identified and quantified by GlycResoft based on the composition,
[ΔHexA = 0, HexA, GlcN, Ac, SO3]. Most of the heparin
lyase II-derived oligosaccharide products were trisulfated disaccharides,
and the normalized percentage of nonreducing end-derived oligosaccharides
obtained from the LMWHs prepared by Sandoz and Celsus were higher
than those obtained from Lovenox (Figure 3B),
suggesting that the parent heparins for these LMWH products were slightly
different in their molecular weight and composition. These differences
between commercial LMWH nonreducing ends were not as obvious using
top-down analysis,16 suggesting an advantage
of this bottom-up approach. The current specifications of heparin
sodium, the parent for each LMWH product, are significantly different
from those used earlier during the market approval process for Lovenox.

Heparin chains are biosynthesized starting from the common carbohydrate–protein
linkage region.30 Nonsulfated oligosaccharide
sequence ΔUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-O-Ser (where
Gal is galactose, Xyl is xylose, and Ser is serine) derived from the
core-protein linkage region is usually present in the commercial heparin.31 Highly sulfated sequences have been identified
that elicit the biological activities of heparin. Other activities,
including antiangiogenic and antiproliferative properties, may also
involve less sulfated sequences encompassing the linkage region.32−34 These studies suggest that linkage region may play a role in modulating
some of the activities of heparin. Therefore, the quantification of
the linkage region is necessary to completely profile a LMWH in the
bottom-up approach. In the LC-MS chromatogram of the digested LMWH,
we observed predominantly oxidized Ser (SerOX) at the reducing
end linkage, instead of Ser (Figures 4 and 5), which is different from the reported heparin
reducing end linkage. Serine is known to be sensitive to radical based
oxidation.39 Reagents, such as hydrogen
peroxide or peroxyacids,37,38 and permanganate
oxidation40 are commonly used conditions
in the processing of the commercial heparins and are also used to
prepare LMWHs.41 The linkage region-O-SerOX has recently been reported in studies on glycol-split periodate
oxidized LMWH products.22 MS/MS provides
more detailed structures, including the location of sulfo groups provided
in the linkage, corresponding to the structures, ΔUA-GlcNAc-GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-O-SerOX and ΔUA-GlcNAc6S-GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-O-SerOX (Figure 5A,B). The linkage region
oligosaccharides of three LMWHs samples were quantified and shown
in Figure 3C. The unsulfated hexasaccharide
(ΔUA-GlcNAc-GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-O-SerOX) was the major linkage region component, consistent with
the linkage region reported in a previous study.36 However, the ratio and content of the three linkage region
oligosaccharides obtained from the LMWH samples in the current study
showed obvious differences. The amount of three linkage region oligosaccharides
derived from the Lovenox sample was much lower than that from the
other two samples. These differences might give some clue to the oxidative
conditions used to process the parent heparin and to prepare these
LMWH products.

Conclusions
In this study, online HILIC LC-FTMS combined
heparin lyase II digestion offers a new method for the bottom-up analysis
of LMWHs. This method is so sensitive that it can detect and identify
as little as 0.01% components and affords a dynamic range of >5000
within about a 7 min chromatographic separation window. The current
method has relatively high throughput but compromised some LC resolution.
The solvent system and sample preparation were carefully selected
to reduce the matrix effect on ionization and promote sensitivity.
On the basis of this method, more than 40 digested components were
observed. The primary unsaturated oligosaccharides, 3-O-sulfo containing tetrasaccharides, 1,6-anhydro rings, saturated
uronic acid at the nonreducing end, and odd-numbered saccharide units
were used to compare three different sources of LMWHs. All of the
LMWHs examined in this study were very similar in structure and composition.
This study provides a useful method with relatively high throughput
and excellent reproducibility for the bottom-up analysis of LMWHs
and is suitable for quality control and/or validation of a LMWH production,
in conjunction with other methods such as LC-MS analysis42 and capillary electrophoresis43 with absorbance detection.
