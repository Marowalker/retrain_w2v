Large scale analysis of proteins
by mass spectrometry is becoming
increasingly routine; however, the presence of peptide isomers remains
a significant challenge for both identification and quantitation in
proteomics. Classes of isomers include sequence inversions, structural
isomers, and localization variants. In many cases, liquid chromatography
is inadequate for separation of peptide isomers. The resulting tandem
mass spectra are composite, containing fragments from multiple precursor
ions. The benefits of high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility
spectrometry (FAIMS) for proteomics have been demonstrated by a number
of groups, but previously work has focused on extending proteome coverage
generally. Here, we present a systematic study of the benefits of
FAIMS for a key challenge in proteomics, that of peptide isomers.
We have applied FAIMS to the analysis of a phosphopeptide library
comprising the sequences GPSGXVpSXAQLX(K/R) and SXPFKXpSPLXFG(K/R),
where X = ADEFGLSTVY. The library has defined limits enabling us to
make valid conclusions regarding FAIMS performance. The library contains
numerous sequence inversions and structural isomers. In addition,
there are large numbers of theoretical localization variants, allowing
false localization rates to be determined. The FAIMS approach is compared
with reversed-phase liquid chromatography and strong cation exchange
chromatography. The FAIMS approach identified 35% of the peptide library,
whereas LC–MS/MS alone identified 8% and LC–MS/MS with
strong cation exchange chromatography prefractionation identified
17.3% of the library.

A challenge
facing mass spectrometry-based
proteomics is the presence of peptide isomers, which cannot be distinguished
on the basis of m/z. In addition
to enantiomers and diastereoisomers, isomers arise through localization
variants of post-translational modifications (that is, peptides with
identical sequences but differing sites of modification), peptides
containing isomeric amino acid residues (e.g., leucine/isoleucine),
and sequence inversions in which the order of amino acid residues
are altered. In addition, structural isomers may arise through different
combinations of amino acid residues. For example, a peptide containing
the residues serine and alanine has identical mass to one in which
those residues are substituted for threonine and glycine. Sequence
variants (sequence inversions and structural isomers) are typically
straightforward to distinguish following tandem mass spectrometry
(MS/MS), either by collision induced dissociation or electron transfer
(or capture) dissociation, provided that a single peptide isomer is
isolated for fragmentation. Difficulties arise when multiple precursors
are selected resulting in compound MS/MS spectra. The presence of
fragments from a variety of precursors both confounds the protein
database search and leads to incorrect quantitation.1,2 Sequence variants can be separated to some extent by liquid chromatography
prior to MS analysis (LC–MS). Nevertheless, Clemmer and co-workers3 showed that this approach lacks the peak capacity
to separate large numbers of isomers. For a 4000 member peptide library,
∼50% of the isobars could be separated by LC.3

Ion mobility spectrometry can be applied for the
separation of
peptide sequence isomers. Hudgins et al. showed the position of lysine
within polyalanine peptides had a strong influence on drift times
as measured by conventional ion mobility.4 Clemmer and co-workers applied conventional ion mobility to the
analysis of large peptide libraries containing numerous sequence variants.3,5 More recently, we have shown that sequence inversions of peptides
containing nitrotyrosine can be separated by use of high-field asymmetric
waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS, also known as differential
ion mobility).6

FAIMS was introduced
by Buryakov et al.7,8 and
is based on the differences in mobility of ions in high and low electric
fields. Ions are infused between two parallel electrodes across which
a voltage is applied via an asymmetric waveform. As a result of their
differential ion mobility in high and low electric fields, ions travel
a greater distance toward one electrode than the other, eventually
colliding with the electrode. To avoid this occurrence, a compensation
voltage (CV) is applied to one electrode. By changing the compensation
voltage, it is possible to selectively transmit ions through the FAIMS
device. FAIMS has successfully been coupled to online nano-LC–MS/MS
for proteomic analyses. Saba et al. showed a 55% increase in the number
of assigned spectra and saw a 10-fold increase in detection limits
when using FAIMS compared to a standard LC–MS/MS approach.9 Swearingen et al.10 demonstrated the improved proteome coverage observed when comparing
LC–MS/MS with multiple LC–FAIMS-MS/MS runs at different
compensation voltages. Improved proteome coverage by use of FAIMS
was also demonstrated in our work on human SUM52 breast carcinoma
cells.11 FAIMS is also able to separate
localization variants of post-translationally modified peptides, and
Bridon et al. have demonstrated the advantages of FAIMS for phosphoproteomics,
identifying several isobaric phosphopeptides.12 Typically, large scale phosphoproteomics is carried out using two-dimensional
liquid chromatography, often strong cation exchange chromatography
coupled with reversed-phase chromatography.13 As for standard proteomics, phosphoproteomics is complicated by
the presence of sequence and positional isomers and coeluting peptides.
The problem was highlighted by a recent study where 3–6% of
phosphopeptides identified from TiO2 enrichment of mouse,
fly, and rat protein extracts were isomers.14 An in silico analysis of the human proteome revealed that approximately
one-fifth of all tryptic human phosphopeptides are potentially multiply
phosphorylated,4 suggesting the problem
is greater than previously thought. Unlike electron transfer (or capture)
dissociation (ETD, ECD),15,16 analysis of phosphopeptides
by CID generally results in the neutral loss of phosphoric acid17 (particularly for serine and threonine phosphorylation),
often at the expense of sequence fragments, further complicating identification
and localization of the peptide/phosphate. Methods have been introduced,
which combine CID with ETD or ECD, such as neutral loss triggered
ECD18 or decision tree analysis,19 to address this limitation. Bridon et al. used
the decision tree approach in their FAIMS analysis of Drosophila
melanogaster.12

Here, we
describe the reversed phase (RP) LC–FAIMS-ETD-MS/MS
analysis of a phosphopeptide library comprising 4000 members of equal
abundance. The library peptides have the sequences GPSGXVpSXAQLX(K/R)
and SXPFKXpSPLXFG(K/R), where X = ADEFGLSTVY. The library has numerous
sequence inversions and structural isomers. The use of a defined library
enables us to assess fully the performance of FAIMS in terms of ability
to separate sequence isomers. The results are compared with RPLC–ETD-MS/MS
in order to assess the benefits of gas-phase fractionation in FAIMS
and with the more widely used two-dimensional approach which combines
prefractionation by strong cation exchange chromatography with RPLC–ETD-MS/MS.
ETD was employed because of its advantages for phosphopeptide analysis.
Again, as a result of using a library of known constraints, we are
able to calculate false localization rates for the sites of phosphorylation.

Experimental
Section
Synthetic Peptides
Two peptide libraries were synthesized
(Alta Biosciences, Birmingham, U.K.) with the basic sequences GPSGXVpSXAQLX(K/R)
and SXPFKXpSPLXFG(K/R), where X = ADEFGLSTVY, resulting in a total
of 4000 peptides. The libraries were combined and resuspended in water
to a concentration of 1 mg/mL. The stock solution was diluted to a
final concentration of ∼35 fmol/μL for RPLC–MS/MS
analyses.

Strong Cation Exchange (SCX) Liquid Chromatography
The combined synthetic libraries (1 mg) were resuspended in 100 μL
of mobile phase A (10 mM KH3PO4, 25% acetonitrile,
pH 3, Sigma Aldrich) and loaded onto a 100 × 2.1 mm polysulfethyl
A column (5 μm particle size, 20 nm pore size, PolyLC, Columbia,
MD) at a flow rate of 200 μL/min. Peptides were separated with
a gradient from 0 to 50% mobile phase B (10 mM KH3PO4, 25% acetonitrile, 500 mM KCl, pH 3, Sigma Aldrich) over
40 min, increasing to 70% B over 5 min before returning to 100% A.
A total of 15 fractions were collected over 54 min. Fractions were
combined as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 + 8, 9 + 10 + 11, and 12
+ 13 + 14 + 15. The combined fractions were dried and resuspended
in trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma Aldrich, 0.5%). Prior to analysis,
the peptides were desalted (C8 cartridge, Michrom) as follows:
Samples were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (0.5%). The trap
was washed with acetonitrile (200 μL) followed by acetonitrile
and water (50/50 + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 200 μL). The trap
was equilibrated with trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%, 300 μL), and
the sample was loaded and washed with trifluoroacetic acid (0.1%,
300 μL). The sample was eluted in acetonitrile and water (70/30
+ 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 100 μL). Each desalted sample was
resuspended in formic acid (0.1%, 110 μL) and diluted by a factor
of 5 to give a final concentration of ∼35 fmol/μL. (Peptide
concentrations are approximate due to the uneven distribution of peptides
between the SCXLC fractions).

RPLC–MS/MS Analysis
Peptides (approximately
173 fmol of each peptide) were loaded onto a 150 mm Acclaim PepMap100
C18 column (LC Packings, Sunnyvale, CA) in mobile phase A (0.1% formic
acid, JT Baker, Holland). Peptides were separated over a 30 min linear
gradient from 3.2% to 44% mobile phase B (acetonitrile +0.1% formic
acid, (JT Baker, Sigma Aldrich) with a flow rate of 350 nL/min. The
column was then washed with 90% mobile phase B (10 min) before re-equilibrating
at 3.2% mobile phase B (15 min). The column oven was heated to 35 °C.
For standard (non-FAIMS) RPLC–MS/MS, the LC system was coupled
to an Advion Triversa Nanomate (Advion, Ithaca, NY) which infused
the peptides with a spray voltage of 1.7 kV. For the FAIMS analyses,
the LC system was coupled to an ADPC-IMS PicoFrit nano-ESI probe (New
Objective, Woburn, MA). The spray voltage was 2.6 kV. In both cases,
ionized peptides were sampled (introduced) into the Velos Orbitrap
ETD mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany).

ETD-MS/MS Analysis
The mass spectrometer performed
a full FT-MS scan (m/z 380–1600)
and subsequent ETD MS/MS scans of the seven most abundant ions above
a threshold of 5 000. Survey scans were acquired in the Orbitrap
with a resolution of 30 000 at m/z 400. Precursor ions were subjected to ETD with supplemental activation
(saETD) in the linear ion trap. The width of the precursor isolation
window was 2 Th, and only multiply charged precursor ions were subjected
to saETD. saETD was performed with fluoranthene ions. Automatic gain
control (AGC) was used to accumulate a sufficient number of charges
(fluoranthene, target 1 × 105, maximum fill time 50
ms). Precursor ions (AGC target 1 × 104, maximum fill
time 100 ms) were activated for 100 ms (charge dependent activation
time was enabled). The dynamic exclusion repeat count was set to 1
with a duration of 60 s. Data acquisition was controlled by Xcalibur
2.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

RPLC–FAIMS-MS/MS
Analysis
The mass spectrometer
parameters in RPLC–FAIMS-MS/MS were the same as those described
above (ETD-MS/MS). The FAIMS device (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San
Jose, CA) was operated under the following conditions: gas flow rate
of 3.5 L/min and a composition of 50/50 He:N2, the dispersion
voltage (DV) was set to −5000 V, and the inner and outer electrodes
temperatures were 70 and 90 °C, respectively. The dwell time
was set to 50 ms. Nine separate RPLC–FAIMS-MS/MS analyses were
performed at compensation voltages (CV) of −25, −27.5,
−30, −32.5, −35, −37.5, −40, −42.5,
and −45 V. (The compensation voltage range used here was determined
as described in the Supporting Information and in Supplemental Figures 1 and 2).

Database Searching
A fasta format database was constructed
containing the 4000 synthetic peptides. Raw data were converted to
dta files in Proteome Discoverer 1.0 (minimum peak count 1, signal/noise
3, and maximum precursor mass 5000 Da) and searched against the database
using Mascot 2.3 and Mascot Daemon 2.2.2. Data from the FAIMS and
non-FAIMS analyses were searched with the same parameters: No enzyme
was selected for digestion with no missed cleavages; precursor ion
tolerance of 5 ppm; fragment ion tolerance 0.5 Da; variable modification
was phosphorylation of serine/threonine. Decoy searching was selected
to establish false discovery rates. Significance thresholds were set
to give false discovery rates of 1%. The search results were manually
filtered for rank 1 peptide identifications, and peptide assignments
with incorrect phosphorylation site localizations were removed.

Results and Discussion
Analysis of Peptide Library
The
peptide libraries contain
peptides with the basic sequences GPSGXVpSXAQLX(K/R) and SXPFKXpSPLXFG(K/R),
where X = ADEFGLSTVY. The combined library contains 4000 peptides
in approximately equal abundance. Each peptide contains three variable
amino acids resulting in between one and six sequence isomers. In
addition, different combinations of amino acids can have equivalent
masses, further extending the number of isomers. In total, there are
556 unique peptide masses contained within the library. The breakdown
of these unique masses and the number of associated isomers is shown
in Supplemental Table 1 in the Supporting Information. (In addition, there are 11 600 serine, threonine, and tyrosine
residues in the peptide library. Of these, 4 000 are phosphorylated
and the remaining 7 600 are “potential” phosphorylation
sites. Although the phosphorylation sites are defined in the library
and no actual phosphorylation localization variants exist, as all
peptides contain at least two serines, every library member has theoretical
localization variants. This aspect is explored further below).

The peptide library was first analyzed by reversed-phase (RP) LC–ETD-MS/MS
without SCX prefractionation. That analysis resulted in 2556 ETD events.
The protein database search identified 329 peptide spectral matches
(PSMs) and a total of 322 unique peptides (Supplemental Table 2 in
the Supporting Information), that is, 8%
of the peptide library. The peptides identified corresponded to 247
unique masses. For 74% (183/247) of those unique masses, a single
sequence was identified. For 21.5% (53/247), two peptide isomers were
identified, and for 4.5% (11/247), three peptide isomers were identified.
These results highlight the need for fractionation of complex peptide
mixtures.

To compare the performance of gas-phase fractionation
by use of
FAIMS and prefractionation by use of strong cation exchange (SCXLC)
for the analysis of peptide sequence isomers, equal amounts of the
peptide library were analyzed by RPLC–FAIMS-ETD-MS/MS and SCXLC
RPLC–ETD-MS/MS. Nine SCX fractions, containing a total of 9
μg of the peptide library, were analyzed by RPLC–ETD-MS/MS.
An equivalent amount (9 μg) was analyzed by RPLC–FAIMS-ETD
using the external CV stepping method. That is, nine analyses of 1 μg
of the peptide library, at CVs of −45, −42.5, −40,
−37.5, −35, −32.5, −30, −27.5,
and −25 V, were performed. For both approaches, the total amount
of instrument time was 9 h. Both data sets were searched against a
custom database containing the synthetic peptides using the Mascot
algorithm. Data were searched both as individual fractions (SCXLC
or CV) and as complete data sets.

The number of nonredundant
phosphopeptides identified per SCX fraction
is shown in Figure 1a. A total of 1212 (redundant)
peptides were identified with a 1% false discovery rate (Supplemental
Table 3 in the Supporting Information).
The histogram shows that the distribution of peptides across the fractions
is not uniform: 45% of the peptides were identified from two fractions
(2 and 6). The UV trace from the SCX fractionation (Supplemental Figure
3 in the Supporting Information) correlates
well with the number of peptides identified per fraction. Combined
analysis of the nine fractions resulted in the identification of 693
unique nonredundant peptides (978 peptide spectral matches) from a
total of 28208 queries, a 2.5% identification rate. (See Supplemental
Table 4 in the Supporting Information).
That is, there was a 42.8% redundancy between SCX fractions, i.e.,
42.8% of the peptide assigned were identified in multiple SCX fractions.
Of the 978 PSMs, 63% corresponded to doubly charged precursor ions
and 37% to triply charged precursor ions. No peptides were identified
with higher charge states. Overall, 17.3% (693/4000) of the peptide
library was identified in the SCX analysis.

Figure 1 (a) Number of peptides
identified per SCXLC fraction and (b) number
of sequence isomers identified per unique precursor mass from the
combined SCXLC analysis.

The number of isomers identified per unique precursor mass
from
the combined SCXLC RPLC–MS/MS analysis is shown in Figure 1b. The peptides identified correspond to 364 unique
masses. For 177 of those unique masses, a single sequence was identified.
For 102 unique masses, two sequence isomers were identified, and for
43, three isomers were identified. The maximum number of sequence
isomers for a given precursor mass was 7. That was observed for m/z 1349.634 only (GPSGLVSGAQLER, GPSGAVSDAQLLR,
GPSGVVSAAQLER, GPSGLVSDAQLAR, GPSGDVSLAQLAR, GPSGDVSAAQLLR, and GPSGEVSGAQLLR).
The average number of sequence isomers identified per precursor mass
was 1.9. (The average number of isomers per precursor mass for the
library is 7.2). Figure 2 (green trace) shows
the number of isomers which were detected for each precursor mass.
The blue trace shows the actual number of sequence isomers present
at each precursor mass.

Figure 2 Number of sequence isomers versus unique precursor
mass: blue trace,
distribution of sequence isomers in peptide library; green trace,
sequence isomers identified in the SCXLC analysis; red trace, sequence
isomers identified in the FAIMS analysis.

Figure 3a shows the number of nonredundant
peptides identified from each of the nine different FAIMS analyses.
The total number of (redundant) peptides identified was 2097 (Supplemental
Table 5 in the Supporting Information).
The distribution of peptides across the nine CV fractions is more
uniform than observed in the SCX fractionation, although 58% (1218)
of the peptides were identified in the CV range −32.5 to −25
V, compared with 42% (879) in the range −45 to −35 V.
None of the FAIMS CV fractions have fewer than 120 peptides, and on
average 233 peptides were identified per CV fraction (compared with
135 peptides identified per SCXLC fraction). Figure 4 shows the distribution of the peptide m/z values versus compensation voltage. It is clear from this
that doubly charged ions elute from the FAIMS over a different CV
range compared to triply charged ions as shown by others with nonmodified
peptides.9 Only one triply charged peptide
was identified at a compensation voltage higher (less negative) than
−35 V. When the combined data were searched, 1388 unique peptides
were identified (Supplemental Table 6 in the Supporting
Information) (2495 PSMs) from a total of 10 712 queries
(23.2% identification rate). The redundancy rate between CV fractions
was 34%, that is 34% of the peptide assignments were observed in multiple
CV fractions. The charge state distribution for the FAIMS analysis
was similar to the SCXLC analysis with 64% of the peptides identified
as doubly charged and 36% identified as triply charged. No higher
charge states were identified and this is not surprising given the
sequences of the peptide libraries. Overall, 35% (1388/4000) of the
peptide library was identified in the FAIMS analysis.

Figure 3 (a) Number of peptides
identified per FAIMS compensation voltage
and (b) number of sequence isomers identified per unique precursor
mass from the combined FAIMS analysis.

Figure 4 Mass-to-charge ratio of the peptides identified from the FAIMS
analysis versus compensation voltage.

A manual analysis of the amino acid compositions of the peptide
sequences identified in the FAIMS analysis was performed. Supplemental
Figure 4a–d in the Supporting Information shows the variation in % of amino acid residues at each substitution
site across the compensation voltages. The analysis shows that threonine
is underrepresented at all substitution sites across all CVs. A decrease
in % leucine between CV −32.5 and −40 V is observed
for all three substitution sites. A similar trend is observed for
aspartic acid on the site closest to the C-terminus. There are no
other obvious trends at any of the sites.

The number of peptide
isomers identified per precursor mass from
the FAIMS data is shown in Figure 3b. Both
the range and distribution are increased in comparison to the SCXLC
analysis. In total, 493 unique masses were identified. Of those unique
masses, 131 (26.6%) were identified as single sequences, 122 corresponded
to two sequence isomers, and 104 to three sequence isomers. The maximum
number of sequence isomers identified for a given precursor mass was
12 (1369.6643 Da). There are three different combinations of the variable
amino acids for this precursor mass: SFL, TVF, and LAY. All six of
the isomers with SFL residues were identified (SFL, SLF, FLS, FSL,
LSF, and LFS), in addition to TVF, FVT, AYL, LAY, ALY, and LYA. The
12 peptides were identified over 8 of the 9 CV fractions. (None were
identified at CV −37.5 V). Three of the SFL isomers were identified
at CV −32.5 V. The remaining SFL isomers were identified at
CVs of −25, −27.5, and −40 V. A total of 11 isomers
were identified for precursor mass 1355.6486 Da. In that case, peptides
were identified from the full range of CV values. The average number
of isomers identified per precursor mass was 2.8 (cf., calculated
average number of isomers per mass in the library of 7.2). The red
trace in Figure 2 shows the distribution of
the isomers across the precursor mass range compared to the SCXLC
analysis (green) and the total number of isomers in the library (blue).
There is no correlation between the precursor mass and the number
of isomers identified.

Gas-phase fractionation by use of FAIMS
clearly outperforms both
1-D and 2-D liquid chromatography for the separation of peptide isomers.
The peptides contained within the library do not differ greatly, and
similar chromatographic behavior might be expected. That is, the low
identification rates observed for RPLC–MS/MS (8%) and SCXLC-RPLC–MS/MS
(17.3%) may be due to coelution of isomeric peptides and the resulting
composite MS/MS spectra. Figure 5a shows the
ETD mass spectrum for the doubly charged precursor of m/z 710.8287 from the SCXLC analysis. Only one peptide
sequence was identified with this mass: GPSGYVpSAAQLYK. There are
two possible additional isomers with the same amino acids (AYY, YYA)
and an additional six isomeric peptides with the substituted amino
acids SVY. There are fragment ions identified that could derive from
all nine of the possible isomers (fragment ion mass accuracy <0.5
Da) and unique fragments for three of the nine isomers (as shown in
Supplemental Table 7 in the Supporting Information) contained within the mass spectrum. In the FAIMS analysis, seven
of the nine peptides were identified over a CV range from −25
to −37.5 V (GPSGSVpSFAQLYK, GPSGSVpSYAQLFK, GPSGYVpSAAQLYK,
GPSGYVpSFAQLSK, GPSGYVpSSAQLFK, GPSGAVpSYAQLYK, and GPSGFVpSYAQLSK).
The peptide GPSGYVpSAAQLYK identified in the SCXLC analysis (Figure 5a) was identified in the FAIMS analysis at a CV
of −25 V (see Figure 5b). All of the
peaks in the spectrum correspond to fragments of this peptide. It
should be noted that all of the fragments of this peptide have identical m/z to fragments from other isomers, however
no fragments unique to other isomers are observed in this spectrum.
This simplification of the ETD mass spectrum afforded by FAIMS separation
may explain why the Mascot identification rate, that is, conversion
of MS/MS spectrum to peptide assignment, is greater for the FAIMS
analysis than the SCXLC analysis (23% cf., 2.5%, respectively).

Figure 5 (Top) ETD mass

precursor m/z 710.8287 from the
SCX analysis. The spectrum was assigned to peptide GPSGYVpSAAQLYK in the database search. Fragments from multiple isomers are
observed. (Bottom) ETD mass spectrum of the peptide ion [GPSGYVpSAAQLYK]2+ from the FAIMS analysis (CV = −25
V).

We, and others, have previously
shown the complementarity between
SCXLC and FAIMS for the identification of peptides (11, 12). Similar
complementarity is demonstrated here. Figure 6 shows the number of peptides identified in the two analyses. A total
of 1690 peptides were identified, that is, 42.3% of the peptide library.
A total of 56% (391) of the peptides identified in the SCX analysis
were also identified in the FAIMS analysis. Of the total peptides
identified, 82% were observed in the FAIMS analysis, with 18% (302)
of the identifications deriving solely from the SCXLC analysis.

Figure 6 Venn diagram
showing the number of unique peptides identified from
the FAIMS (blue) and SCX analysis (pink).

To investigate whether any correlation exists between SCX
elution
profile and compensation voltage, the peptides identified at CV −27.5
V were considered in terms of their corresponding SCX fraction (if
any). A total of 67 peptides identified at CV −27.5 V were
also identified in the SCX analysis. Of these, 33 were identified
in SCX fraction 6. No more than 10 were identified from any other
single SCX fraction. While this result might suggest a correlation,
it should be noted that fraction 6 was the most populated SCX fraction
(230 out of 693 peptides identified), and this result may simply illustrate
the limited separation capabilities of SCX.

In the searches
described above, phosphorylation of serine/threonine
was specified as a variable modification. This was necessary because
although the site of phosphorylation in the library peptides was fixed,
unmodified serine was also present. That is, all peptides contain
both phosphorylated and unmodified serine. The search results were
filtered for rank 1 peptides and a 1% FDR and further filtered manually
to remove those assignments with incorrect phosphorylation site. However,
the use of the phosphopeptide library provides an opportunity to assess
the false localization rate (FLR) resulting from the protein database
searches. As above the search results were filtered for rank 1 peptides
and a 1% FDR, but peptide assignments with incorrect phosphorylation
sites were retained. An additional 23 peptides were “assigned”
from the FAIMS data set and an additional 22 peptides from the SCXLC
data set. The FLR, calculated as the number of falsely localized PSMs/total
number of PSMs, was 0.9% for the FAIMS data set and 2.2% for the SCXLC
data set.

Conclusions
By use of a large and
defined phosphopeptide library containing
numerous sequence inversions and structural isomers, tryptic in nature,
we have investigated a key challenge in mass spectrometry-based proteomics,
that of peptide isomers. We have shown that reversed-phase LC alone
provides inadequate separation of isomers. Only 8% of the library
was identified. Prefractionation of the peptides by use of strong
cation exchange chromatography results in a 2-fold increase in the
number of peptide assignments (17% of the peptide library); however,
the majority of the unique peptide masses were assigned to single
sequences, indicating that many peptide isomers were not separated.
Indeed, manual inspection reveals the composite nature of the MS/MS
spectra. Further support for this conclusion comes from the conversion
rate of MS/MS spectra to peptide assignment, just 2.5%. Gas-phase
separation of the peptides by use of FAIMS resulted in a further 2-fold
increase in peptide assignments (35% of the library). The proportion
of single sequence isomers was reduced (from 49% to 27%) and the maximum
number of isomers identified for a unique mass was 12. The ETD mass
spectra were simplified and the “MS/MS to assignment”
conversion rate was increased to 23%. In summary, we have demonstrated
that use of FAIMS in the mass spectrometry workflow is the more suitable
approach to address the problem of peptide isomers.
