• Rapid adaptation of feeding behaviour to scheduled
palatable diet access

• No evidence of reduced feeding (hypophagia) prior to
scheduled palatable meals

• Mice exhibit food anticipatory activity (FAA) prior
to scheduled palatable meals

• Continuing presence of FAA when scheduled palatable
mealsare withdrawn

• Immediate hyperphagic response once the palatable
meals are restored after 7 days



Male C57BL/6 mice fed ad libitum
on control diet but allowed access to a palatable high fat diet (HFD) for 2 h a
day during the mid-dark phase rapidly adapt their feeding behaviour and can
consume nearly 80% of their daily caloric intake during this 2 h-scheduled feed.
We assessed food intake microstructure and meal pattern, and locomotor activity
and rearing as markers of food anticipatory activity (FAA). Schedule fed mice
reduced their caloric intake from control diet during the first hours of the
dark phase but not during the 3-h period immediately preceding the scheduled
feed. Large meal/binge-like eating behaviour during the 2-h scheduled feed was
characterised by increases in both meal number and meal size. Rearing was
increased during the 2-h period running up to scheduled feeding while locomotor
activity started to increase 1 h before, indicating that schedule-fed mice
display FAA. Meal number and physical activity changes were sustained when HFD
was withheld during the anticipated scheduled feeding period, and mice
immediately binged when HFD was represented after a week of this “withdrawal”
period. These findings provide important context to our previous studies
suggesting that energy balance systems in the hypothalamus are not responsible
for driving these large, binge-type meals. Evidence of FAA in HFD dark phase
schedule-fed mice implicates anticipatory processes in binge eating that do not
involve immediately preceding hypophagia or regulatory homeostatic
signalling.

Introduction
Feeding is driven, in large part, by energy homeostasis – the
balance between food intake and energy expenditure. Humans and many mammals
consume their energy in the form of periodic bouts or meals. However, the
initiation of a meal is not necessarily based on a general energy deficit or a
specific need such as an inadequate glucose level. The impulse to initiate a
meal may rather be based on factors such as time of the day, eating habits,
social environment, or convenience (Woods, 2005). The ability to estimate time and anticipate
critical events such as meal time is of relevance in nature, since it has clear
implications for survival (Strubbe
& Woods, 2004). In laboratory animals, restricted
meal-feeding schedules may limit food availability to a single daily meal. Once
habituated to these feeding conditions, animals have been shown to anticipate
their next meal through adaptations such as increases in locomotor activity,
body temperature and hormone release that precede the predicted meals
(Verwey & Amir,
2009). The behavioural response is known as food anticipatory
activity (FAA), and the 2 h to 3 h period preceding a daily scheduled meal is
the relevant time frame (Challet,
Mendoza, Dardente, & Pévet, 2009; Mistlberger, 1994; Shibata, Hirao, & Tahara,
2010). FAA is not just limited to restricted feeding
schedules, i.e. where food is available for only a short time a day. The reward
value of food and its motivational properties have also been implicated in food
entrainment since FAA can also be induced in animals fed on palatable feeding
schedules, where a stock diet is available for the remainder of the day
(Mendoza, 2007;
Mistlberger & Rusak,
1987).

A palatable scheduled feeding model, described by Berner et al.
(Berner, Avena, &
Hoebel, 2008), based on dietary manipulations by Corwin
et al. (Corwin et al.,
1998; Dimitriou,
Rice, & Corwin, 2000) and Mistlberger et al.
(Mistlberger & Rusak,
1987), induces substantial food intake over short periods of
time in rats (Berner et al.,
2008). Utilising this model, we provided scheduled access to
a solid high fat palatable diet (HFD) for a 2-h period each day, without imposed
caloric restriction during the remainder of the day, a manipulation that
resulted in consumption of large, binge-type meals in both rats and mice
(Bake, Duncan, Morgan,
& Mercer, 2013). Interestingly, mice exhibited a
more exaggerated response to the scheduled palatable diet manipulation, with
about 80% of total daily calories consumed during the 2-h access (Bake et al., 2013). The present
study further characterises the large meal/binge-like eating model at a
behavioural level in mice, focussing on how palatable scheduled feeding
influences food intake microstructure and meal patterns. We also measured
activity patterns (locomotor activity and rearing) as markers of FAA in mice on
scheduled palatable diet. In addition, we extended the model beyond the
habituated response to palatable schedule feeding to assess food intake
microstructure, meal patterns and activity patterns when the palatable scheduled
feeding on HFD was withdrawn and then reintroduced.

Materials and methods
Animals
Six male C57BL/6 mice (Harlan, Bicester, UK), with initial
body weights of approximately 22 g at 7 weeks of age, were placed under a
reversed 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 16:00, ZT0; lights off at
04:00, ZT12; ZT, zeitgeber time) immediately upon arrival and were allowed
to acclimatise as a group. After 2 weeks, mice were single housed in TSE
PhenoMaster/LabMaster feeding/drinking monitoring cages (TSE Systems, Bad
Homburg, Germany) and acclimatised for a week further before the start of 1
week of baseline food intake and locomotor activity measurements (phase 1).
All mice were fed ad libitum standard pellet diet
(Special Diet Services, Witham, UK; #871505 CRM (P); 22% protein, 69%
carbohydrate, 9% fat by energy, 2.67 kcal/g) unless otherwise noted. Water
was freely available at all times during the experiments. The ambient
temperature and humidity in the animal room and in the wire-top experimental
cages were c. 21°C and c. 50%, respectively. All procedures were licensed
under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 and received approval
from the Ethical Review Committee at the Rowett Institute of Nutrition and
Health.

Dietary manipulation
Following baseline measurements (phase 1), all mice
underwent the same dietary manipulations, performed with pelleted HFD
(Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA, #D12492; 20% protein, 20%
carbohydrate, 60% fat by energy, 5.24 kcal/g). During phases 2 and 3, all
mice had scheduled access to HFD for 2 h a day from ZT18 to ZT20 (6 h to 8 h
into the dark phase, as employed by (Berner et al., 2008)) and standard pellet
diet in the remaining time (phase 2, adaptation; phase 3, habituation). Due
to the longitudinal development of binge-type feeding, phases 2 and 3 are
termed “adaptation” and “habituation”, respectively. After 17 days of HFD
scheduled feeding, for phase 4, the mice were switched back to standard
pellet diet during scheduled feeding time (i.e. standard diet available 24 h
a day; termed “replacement”). After a further 7 days, mice were returned to
HFD during scheduled feeding time for 7 more days in phase 5, termed
“refeeding”. Body weight was measured three times a week.

Food intake measurement and food intake
microstructure analysis
During phases 1–5, food intake was measured using the TSE
PhenoMaster/LabMaster system, which automatically records the weight of food
eaten to a sensitivity of 0.01 g through a calibrated sensor. Food spillage
was minimised by a catch tray underneath the food hopper. For assessing HFD
intake during scheduled feeding, food hoppers containing the diet were
exchanged using the “food refill” menu in the software at ZT18 and then
again at ZT20. Food hoppers were also exchanged during baseline and
replacement phases to standardise the amount of disturbance each day.
Cumulative food intake was recorded at intervals of 5 min and summarised in
1 h bins and then averaged per mouse and study phase.

Meal pattern analysis
Data for meal analysis was collected as binary data every
10 s. Meal analysis was done as “so called” sequence analysis, whereby all
meals occurring during the study period were recorded chronologically to
allow the evaluation of single feeding episodes. The start of a meal was
defined by food removal equal to or larger than 0.05 g and the meal was
ended when no further food removal occurred before the end of the inter-meal
interval of 15 min. The meal parameters (meal number and meal size) were
then summarised over seven time periods – total day (ZT0–24), light phase
(ZT0–12), dark phase (ZT13–24), early dark phase (ZT13–15), mid dark phase
(ZT16–18), scheduled feeding time (ZT19–20), and late dark phase (ZT21–24),
and then averaged per mouse and study phase. A 15 min inter-meal interval is
commonly used in defining meals in mice (Atalayer & Rowland, 2011) and
rats (Farley, Cook, Spar, Austin,
& Kowalski, 2003).

Locomotor activity measurement and
analysis
Activity was measured using a multicage activity monitoring
system (Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy). Each cage had a horizontal sensor frame
for monitoring locomotor activity such as walking and running, and a
vertical sensor frame for rearing and exploratory activity. Activity was
measured as infrared beam breaks per 15 min interval, and was recorded via
WinDas 2006 software (Ugo Basile). Horizontal and vertical activity data
were separately summarised at 1 h intervals and then averaged per mouse and
study phase.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with SigmaPlot 12.0
(Systat Software, Chicago, IL, USA). Diurnal differences in food intake
microstructure and locomotor activity pattern during baseline were analysed
with one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (one-way RM ANOVA).
Longitudinal measurements of food intake and physical activity were analysed
by two-way RM ANOVA for effect of “study phase” and “time point”, and
interactions between these factors. Data for meal pattern were analysed by
one-way RM ANOVA to reveal overall effects between study phases. When the
data were not normally distributed and/or variances were not equal, a
non-parametric ANOVA on ranks was performed. Post hoc
and planned comparisons were assessed with Student–Newman–Keul Tests (SNK).
Outcomes were considered statistically significant if P values were lower
than 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean
(SEM).

Results
The study consisted of five phases: baseline measurements on
standard pellet diet (phase 1), “adaptation” and “habituation” periods when
pelleted HFD was fed by scheduled access for 2 h a day with standard pellet diet
in the remaining time (phases 2 and 3, respectively), “replacement”, when mice
were switched back to standard pellet diet during scheduled feeding time (i.e.
standard diet available 24 h a day; phase 4), and “refeeding”, when mice were
returned to HFD during scheduled feeding time (phase 5).

Food intake and body weight
Study phase had a significant effect on mean caloric intake
when analysed in 2 h, 22 h or 24 h bins (P < 0.001). When mice were
schedule fed on HFD for 2 h a day in the middle of the dark phase to
replicate the manipulation described by Berner et al. (Berner et al., 2008), they
rapidly adapted their feeding behaviour to scheduled access conditions and
binged on HFD, such that by the second day of HFD access, near maximal
caloric intake was achieved (Fig. 1A). By contrast,
the displacement of calories from standard diet in the remaining 22 h
occurred more slowly, reaching a nadir after 7 days (Fig. 1B). For this reason the
first 7 days are referred to as the adaptation phase. The following 10 days
on scheduled HFD were termed the habituation phase since caloric intake
during both 2 h and 22 h bins was relatively stable. The percentages of
calories consumed from HFD during the adaptation or habituation phases were
68.3% and 78.0%, respectively, indicative of large meal/binge-like
behaviour, compared with just 9.6% of total calories consumed during the
same 2 h period in the baseline phase. Notably, compensation for calories
from scheduled access was incomplete since total caloric intake was
increased during adaptation and habituation phases (Fig. 1C) (SNK,
P < 0.001 versus baseline). After 17 days of
HFD scheduled feeding, mice were returned to baseline feeding conditions
with standard diet during scheduled feeding. Two-hour caloric intake
decreased immediately to a stable lower level whereas 22 h intake again
adapted more slowly (Fig. 1A,B). Total caloric intake was minimal on the
first day of the replacement phase and thereafter increased slowly to
baseline levels (Fig. 1C). The overall percentage of calories consumed
during the 2 h scheduled feeding time was 18.2%, significantly higher than
that during baseline (SNK, P < 0.05). After a further 7 days, mice
were again given scheduled access to HFD. Two-hour caloric intake increased
immediately to a level comparable to the habituation phase, and continued to
increase gradually across the 7-day phase and was higher on the last day of
the refeeding phase compared with several days of the adaptation and
habituation phases (day 38; P < 0.05 versus
adaptation days 8, 9, 11 and 12, and habituation days 15 and 23;
P < 0.1 versus adaptation day 10 and
habituation days 18 and 24); overall percentage of calories from HFD was at
73.6%. The 22 h caloric intake from standard diet decreased slowly as
observed previously in the adaptation phase. Total caloric intake during the
refeeding phase was higher than in the adaptation and habituation phases
(Fig. 1C) (SNK,
P = 0.031 and P < 0.001).

Body weight reflected changes in caloric intake (one-way RM
ANOVA, P < 0.001), slowly increasing during adaptation and
habituation phases (habituation days 17 to 24, P < 0.05
versus baseline days 1 to 5, and adaptation days
8 to 12), stalling during the replacement phase before increasing again,
more rapidly, in the final refeeding phase (Fig. 1D) (refeeding days 34 to 38,
P < 0.05 versus all other days; P = 0.022 day
36 versus 34; P = 0.055 day 38
versus 36).

Food intake microstructure
Analysis of the baseline phase showed that mice displayed a
clear diurnal rhythm of food intake (one-way RM ANOVA; P < 0.001;
Fig. 2). Food intake
started to increase during the last hour of the light phase at ZT12 (i.e.
data from ZT11 to ZT12) (SNK; P < 0.05 versus
all other ZT intervals) and was always higher during dark phase than during
light phase (SNK; at ZT13 to ZT24, P < 0.05
versus ZT1 to ZT12). During mid-dark phase, food
intake was at an intermediate level compared with other dark phase and light
phase intervals (SNK; at ZT20, P < 0.05 versus
all other ZT intervals).

There were significant interactions between study phases and
time intervals for dietary energy intake (two-way RM ANOVA;
P < 0.001; Fig. 2), but no differences between any study phases
during the light phase. For clarity, Fig. 2 shows post
hoc comparisons of each 1 h ZT interval with baseline phase.
These outcomes are summarised briefly before further analysis of relevant
dark phase bins (Fig. 3). During
adaptation and habituation phases, schedule-fed mice had increased caloric
intake (from HFD) during scheduled feeding time (ZT19–20), a decreased
caloric intake from standard diet during the first 3 hours of the dark phase
(ZT13 to ZT15), and a very low caloric intake in the hours following the
scheduled feed (ZT21 to ZT24). In contrast, during the 3-hour period running
up to the scheduled feed, caloric intake did not differ from baseline
(ZT16–18). During replacement, mice retained an increased caloric intake,
but from standard diet, during the scheduled access period (ZT19–20),
whereas during refeeding, food intake pattern resembled the adaptation and
habituation phase.

According to the main changes seen in the 1 h caloric
intakes, data were then analysed in relevant time bins across the dark
phase: early dark phase (ZT13–15), mid dark phase (ZT16–18), scheduled
feeding time (ZT19–20) and late dark phase (ZT21–24) and the study phases
were compared with baseline (Fig. 3). During all study phases – adaptation,
habituation, replacement and refeeding – there were decreases in caloric
intake from standard diet during early dark phase (P = 0.003,
P < 0.001, P = 0.007 and P < 0.001, respectively) and late
dark phase (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.012 and
P < 0.001, respectively) and an increase in caloric intake either
from HFD or standard diet during scheduled feeding time (P < 0.001,
P < 0.001, P = 0.031 and P < 0.001, respectively).

Mice consumed 7.85 ± 0.33 kcal HFD within the 2 h scheduled
access during the habituation phase. Further analysis in 15-min bins
revealed that approximately one-third of this intake occurred in the first
15 min (2.71 ± 0.24 kcal, 34.5% of the 2-h intake, 26.3% of total caloric
intake; Fig. 4A). A similar
pattern was observed in the refeeding phase, although more calories were
consumed in the first 15 min (3.87 ± 0.17 kcal of a total of
8.81 ± 0.61 kcal, 43.7% of the 2-h intake, 34.2% of total caloric intake;
one-way ANOVA, P = 0.003 versus habituation;
Fig. 4B). On day
1 of the refeeding phase, a large proportion of calories was consumed in the
first 15 min (4.62 ± 0.37 kcal of a total of 7.83 ± 0.60 kcal, 59.0% of the
2-h intake, 46.1% of total caloric intake; Fig. 4C).

Meal pattern analysis
There were effects of study phase on both meal number
(Fig. 5A) and meal size
(Fig. 5B) when
analysing over the complete day, the light phase, the whole dark phase,
early dark phase, the scheduled feeding time or late dark phase (one-way RM
ANOVA; P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001,
P < 0.001, P < 0.001 and P < 0.001 for meal number;
P < 0.001, P = 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.004, P < 0.001
and P < 0.008 for meal size, respectively). There were no effects on
meal number and meal size when analysing over the mid dark phase, the 3 h
time period prior to scheduled feeding time. Meal number was decreased over
the day, the light phase, the whole dark phase, early dark phase and late
dark phase during adaptation, habituation and refeeding (SNK; day,
P < 0.001, P < 0.001 and P < 0.001
versus baseline; light phase, P = 0.003,
P = 0.003 and P = 0.009 versus baseline; whole dark
phase, P < 0.001, P < 0.001 and P < 0.001
versus baseline; early dark phase,
P < 0.001, P < 0.001 and P < 0.001
versus baseline; late dark phase,
P < 0.001, P < 0.001 and P < 0.001
versus baseline) and also during replacement in
the dark phase, early dark phase and late dark phase (SNK; P = 0.067,
P = 0.015 and P < 0.001 versus baseline).
However, during the scheduled feeding time, mice increased meal number
during adaptation, habituation, replacement and refeeding (SNK;
P < 0.001 versus baseline). Meal size
increased over the day, the whole dark phase and scheduled feeding time when
mice had scheduled access to HFD (SNK; P = 0.023, P < 0.05 and
P < 0.001 versus baseline during adaptation;
P = 0.005, P < 0.05 and P < 0.001
versus baseline during habituation;
P < 0.001, P < 0.05 and P < 0.001
versus baseline during refeeding). Furthermore,
meal size during scheduled feeding was largest during the refeeding phase
(SNK; P = 0.002 and P = 0.006 versus adaptation and
habituation). However when the dark phase was broken down further, there
were decreases in meal size during the early dark phase (SNK; P = 0.056,
P = 0.002 and P = 0.028 baseline versus adaptation,
habituation and refeeding) and late dark phase (SNK; P < 0.05
baseline versus habituation). During the light phase,
meal size decreased when mice had scheduled access to HFD (SNK; P = 0.007,
P < 0.001 and P = 0.16 versus baseline during
adaptation, habituation and refeeding).

Activity pattern
Analysis of the baseline phase demonstrated clear diurnal
rhythms of both horizontal and vertical activity (one-way RM ANOVA;
P < 0.001). Horizontal activity started to increase during the last
hour of the light phase (SNK; at ZT12, P < 0.05
versus all other ZT intervals) and was elevated
during the whole of the dark phase and the first hour of the light phase
(SNK; at ZT13 to ZT1, P < 0.05 versus ZT2 to
ZT12). There were three peaks in dark phase horizontal activity (SNK; at
ZT13, ZT19 and ZT24, P < 0.05 versus remaining
ZT intervals), whereas the lowest dark phase levels were observed around the
mid dark phase (SNK; at ZT20 and ZT22, P < 0.05
versus all other ZT intervals). Vertical activity
at baseline gave a similar picture, with an increase during the last hour of
the light phase (SNK; at ZT12, P < 0.05 versus
all other ZT intervals), elevated activity during most of the dark phase and
in the first hour of the light phase (SNK; at ZT13 to ZT19, ZT21, ZT23 to
ZT1, P < 0.005 versus ZT2 to ZT12), with the
exception of ZT20 and ZT22.

There were significant interactions between study phase and
time interval for both horizontal activity (two-way RM ANOVA;
P < 0.001; Fig. 6A,C,E,G) and
vertical activity (P = 0.028; Fig. 6B,D,F,H). For clarity, Fig. 6 shows post
hoc comparisons of each 1 h ZT interval with baseline phase.
These outcomes are summarised briefly before further analysis of relevant
dark phase bins (Fig. 7). For horizontal
activity, there were no differences between study phases during the light
phase. Increases in horizontal activity (versus
baseline) were mainly observed during the mid-dark phase; the 1 h interval
prior to scheduled feeding (ZT18) showed an increase in horizontal activity
for all study phases. Decreases in horizontal activity
(versus baseline) were mainly seen during the
early dark phase, e.g. at ZT13 during habituation, replacement and
refeeding. For vertical activity, there were similar patterns. Increases in
vertical activity (versus baseline) were mainly
observed during the mid-dark phase; the 1 h interval prior to scheduled
feeding (ZT18) showed increases in vertical activity during all study phases
and the interval 2 h prior to scheduled feeding (ZT17) also showed an
increase during adaptation and habituation. Decreases in vertical activity
(versus baseline) were mainly seen during the
early dark phase; during habituation, replacement and refeeding, there were
decreases at ZT13 and ZT15.

According to the changes seen in the 1 h data for horizontal
and vertical activity, data were then analysed in relevant 2 h bins over the
dark phase: 2 h before scheduled feeding (ZT17–18), scheduled feeding time
(ZT19–20) and 2 h after scheduled feeding (ZT21–22), and the study phases
were compared with baseline (Fig. 7). Analysis revealed that during adaptation there
were trends towards increases in vertical activity preceding and during
scheduled feeding time (P = 0.066 and P = 0.063, respectively). During
habituation, vertical activity was increased in the 2 h bin preceding
scheduled feeding (P = 0.006) and there was a trend
for increased horizontal activity preceding scheduled feeding (P = 0.094).
During the replacement phase, vertical activity was increased during
scheduled feeding time (P = 0.004).

Discussion
Providing mice with a palatable high fat diet for a 2-h period
each day without caloric restriction is very effective in promoting hyperphagia
during the access period (Fig. 1A). Consistent with previous reports, when control
diet was replaced during scheduled feeding (Bake et al., 2013), mice rapidly adapted
their feeding behaviours and binged on the palatable high fat diet
(Fig. 1C),
exhibiting a larger binge-like meal than rats under the same dietary regime
(Bake et al.,
2013; Bake, Morgan,
& Mercer, 2014). Furthermore, mice showed an
increase in body weight (Fig. 1D), as previously reported for feeding regimes
offering an unrestricted amount of palatable diet (e.g. HFD, peanut butter,
cheese) during a fixed time interval (Bake et al., 2013, 2014). This is in
contrast to the effect on body weight of feeding paradigms that provide a fixed
amount of a palatable food (corresponding to 30–35% of total caloric intake) at
the same time every day, where there is a lack of body weight gain in mice
(Gallardo, Gunapala, King,
& Steele, 2012; Hsu, Patton, Mistlberger, & Steele,
2010a). Whereas mice in the fixed amount paradigm consumed
similar or even higher amounts of calories each day, the relative proportion of
palatable diet consumed each day (up to 78% in the current study) might be
responsible for the differential effect.

To characterise this mouse model at a behavioural level, we
focused on: (i) differences in the microstructure of feeding behaviour between
schedule-feeding (adaptation and habituation phase) and control feeding
(baseline phase), (ii) changes in meal size and number under these feeding
regimes, (iii) assessment of activity patterns prior to scheduled feeding as a
marker of food anticipatory activity (FAA), and (iv) consequences on feeding
microstructure, meal patterns and activity patterns when palatable scheduled
feeding is withdrawn in favour of control feeding (replacement phase) and then
reintroduced again (refeeding phase).

Changes in feeding microstructure and meal
pattern
As anticipated (Kohsaka et al., 2007), during baseline ad
libitum feeding conditions, mice showed a clear diurnal
rhythm of food intake, consuming most of their food (approximately 85%)
during the dark phase (Fig. 2). Food intake was relatively consistent across
the dark phase without clear peaks. This is in contrast to the three dark
phase peaks observed in rats during early-, mid- and late-dark phase, the
latter of which is the highest (Bake et al., 2014).

When mice were schedule-fed on palatable HFD, there was a
shift in food intake towards the mid-dark phase. Schedule-fed mice showed a
large reduction in control diet intake during the early hours of the dark
phase and in the hours following the scheduled feed. However, notably, and
in line with our previous observations in rats (Bake et al., 2014), schedule-fed mice did
not significantly reduce their control diet intake when analysed in 1 h
intervals (Fig. 2A,C,F) or change their meal pattern (Fig. 5A,B) during the 3 h
period running up to scheduled feeding on HFD, the time frame for food
anticipation and FAA. Analysing caloric intake as a corresponding 3 h bin
during this time confirmed that there was no active anticipatory hypophagia
during adaptation, habituation and refeeding (Fig. 3A,B,D). Overall, these observations
suggest that schedule-fed mice were not in a hypocaloric, negative energy
balance state immediately prior to schedule feeding.

Analysis of food intake microstructure in 15-min bins
indicated that schedule-fed mice consumed HFD across the 2-h access period
(Fig. 4A). The
first 15-min bin saw the highest intake, yet only accounted for
approximately one-third of HFD intake during the access period. The same
analysis in rats suggested that a state approaching satiety was reached
after 15 min of access since schedule-fed rats consumed approximately
three-quarters of their intake of HFD in this time (Bake et al., 2014). Species
differences in postprandial satiety with schedule-fed palatable diets may be
an interesting avenue for further investigation.

Hyperphagia during scheduled feeding time was due to mice
eating more frequent (Fig. 5A) and substantially larger meals (Fig. 5B). Larger meal sizes
have been reported previously in rats fed ad libitum
on high fat pellet diet (Melhorn
et al., 2010) or high fat liquid diet (Warwick, McGuire, Bowen, &
Synowski, 2000), as well as in rats prone to DIO compared
with DIO-resistant rats fed on a high fat diet (Farley et al., 2003).

Entrainment of FAA
Despite the limited effect of scheduled feeding on food
intake microstructure during the 3 h period prior to HFD access in both mice
(current study) and rats (Bake
et al., 2014), there were substantial changes in activity
pattern in this time frame. The 2 h to 3 h period preceding a daily
scheduled meal is regarded as the crucial time frame for FAA (Challet et al., 2009;
Mistlberger,
1994; Shibata
et al., 2010). Anticipation of “mealtime” can be observed
in a range of behaviours, including wheel running, lever pressing, activity
directed at feeders, general cage activity, and drinking, and represents a
laboratory analogue of natural foraging behaviours (Mendoza, 2007; Mistlberger, 1994). In the
current study, the diurnal rhythm seen in food intake during baseline was
reflected in the pattern of both locomotor activity (Fig. 6A,C,E,G) and rearing
activity (Fig. 6B,D,F,H), with peaks at the beginning, middle and
end of the dark phase, a predictable nocturnal pattern (Kohsaka et al., 2007).
However, it is important to note that whereas food consumption was recorded
automatically, diet changes for scheduled feeding were done manually in the
absence of automated access hardware. Consequently, activity peaks during
the mid-dark phase (at ZT19 and ZT21) will have been influenced by the need
to manually change the food hopper. To control for this disturbance effect,
the physical manipulations were performed daily throughout all study phases
even when no actual change of diet was required during baseline and
replacement phases.

The diurnal pattern of activity seen during baseline
persisted when mice were schedule-fed on HFD, albeit with a lower intensity
during the early hours of the dark phase. There was no major shift in
activity towards different time points. Crucially, rearing activity was
increased in the 2 h period prior to scheduled feeding once the feeding
behaviour was habituated to scheduled access conditions, and locomotor
activity was increased during the 1-h period prior to scheduled feeding.
This increase in activity is strongly indicative of FAA, with complementary
analysis at each 1 h interval and in 2 h dark phase bins suggesting that FAA
is strongest in the hour immediately before scheduled feeding. This may
represent a novel finding in this model, i.e. FAA in mice prior to palatable
meal feeding in the dark phase. Most studies investigating food anticipatory
behaviour/FAA have employed restricted feeding schedules, which induce
robust increases in activity in anticipation of the predicted meal, i.e.
when food is not available. In rats, increases in locomotor activity are
observed 2–3 h prior to meals of chow in the light phase (Escobar, Martínez-Merlos,
Ángeles-Castellanos, Del Carmen Miñana, & Buijs,
2007; Mendoza,
Ángeles-Castellanos, & Escobar, 2005;
Verwey, Khoja, Stewart,
& Amir, 2007). FAA has been shown in mice
prior to daily meals of chow in the mid-light phase through an increase in
the combined activity rate for walking, hanging, jumping and rearing during
the 3 h period prior to a 2 h meal (Gunapala, Gallardo, Hsu, & Steele,
2011), as an increase in wheel running during the 3 h
period prior to a 4 h meal (Blum
et al., 2009), or as an increase in locomotor activity
during the 2 h period prior to a 4 h meal (Davis, Choi, Clegg, & Benoit,
2011). Mice may be capable of anticipating 2 or 3 meals
per day (Luby et al.,
2012). However, fewer studies have investigated food
anticipatory behaviour under palatable feeding schedules similar to the one
used in the current study. In rats, FAA was observed on access to palatable
food in the mid-light phase (Dailey, Stingl, & Moran, 2012; Merkestein et al., 2012).
However, in some studies, FAA occurred with a lower intensity (Mendoza et al., 2005) or not
in all animals of the study population (Verwey et al., 2007). In mice, it has
been shown that FAA has some diet specificity; a palatable feeding schedule
with high fat diet (Hsu et al.,
2010a), peanut butter or cheese (Gallardo et al., 2012)
induced a moderate increase in high intensity activity (walking, hanging,
jumping and rearing) during the 2 h period prior to mealtime in the late
light phase, whereas mice on a palatable feeding schedule with chocolate or
fruit crunchies (nutritionally balanced fruit-flavoured pellets) did not
exhibit FAA (Hsu et al.,
2010a).

In most studies investigating FAA, the food is given in the
light phase to make observation easier, although one study of mice
investigated FAA prior to feeding for 2 h at the beginning of the dark phase
(Liu et al.,
2012). However, light-phase manipulations will disrupt
the sleep–wake cycle (Eckel-Mahan
& Sassone-Corsi, 2013). For example, feeding
or forced activity for 8 h during the normal resting phase desynchronises
the rhythm between the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the light-entrainable
circadian oscillator, and the liver, disturbs molecular rhythms within the
liver, and leads to a loss of blood glucose rhythm and to overweight in rats
(Salgado-Delgado,
Ángeles-Castellanos, Buijs, & Escobar, 2008;
Salgado-Delgado et al.,
2013). Similar consequences have been shown for mice
sleep restricted for 6 h during the light phase or fed during the light
phase only, with rhythms of metabolic genes or circadian genes in the liver
being disturbed (Barclay et al.,
2012; Damiola
et al., 2000). Moreover, feeding mice with a high fat
diet during the light phase was reported to contribute to weight gain in
comparison to high fat diet feeding in the dark phase only (Arble, Bass, Laposky, Vitaterna,
& Turek, 2009). In the current study, we show
that it is possible to characterise FAA superimposed on normal activity
during the active dark phase when mice are not food restricted.

The entrainment of FAA and the timing of meals have been
linked to the food entrainable oscillator (FEO) that can work independently
from the circadian clock in the SCN (Escobar, Cailotto, Ángeles-Castellanos, Delgado,
& Buijs, 2009; Strubbe & Woods, 2004),
although it requires a predictable gap between food presentations, an
entrained circadian periodicity of 23–29 h, and will persist for several
cycles despite continuous fasting, indicating the presence of an independent
food clock (Challet et al.,
2009; Stephan,
1981). Many studies have attempted to locate the FEO in
the central nervous system, but its whereabouts still have to be determined
(Challet et al.,
2009; Mendoza,
2007). The FEO might be a distributed network of
interacting nuclei each with a different function in the process of
mediating FAA, rather than a single structure (Escobar et al., 2009; Mendoza, 2007).

Consequences of withdrawing and reintroducing
palatable meals
Previous exposure to the palatable scheduled feeding regime
had consequences for body weight, food intake microstructure and meal
pattern, as well as activity pattern in the later study phases. After the
initial increase during adaptation, body weight plateaued during
habituation. However, body weight decreased after withdrawal of HFD during
the replacement phase and then rapidly increased after the reintroduction of
HFD. It is reasonable to assume that further cycles of replacement and
refeeding would lead to a pattern of weight cycling (Barbosa-da-Silva, da Silva, Aguila,
& Mandarim-de-Lacerda, 2013; Barbosa-da-Silva, Fraulob-Aquino, Lopes,
Mandarim-de-Lacerda, & Aguila, 2012). It has
also been shown that weight cycling under such conditions leads to
substantial modification of blood lipids, glucose and insulin homeostasis,
adipokine levels, and proinflammatory cytokines (Barbosa-da-Silva et al., 2012), and a
structural remodelling of the liver (Barbosa-da-Silva et al., 2013), changes
which were not reversed when mice lost body weight during the switch to chow
feeding (Barbosa-da-Silva et al., 2012, 2013). In addition, the
increase in adiposity resulting from high fat diet feeding cannot easily be
reversed by reducing body weight when switching back to chow feeding; mice
retained the increased number of adipocytes that were accumulated during
high fat diet feeding, although adipocyte volumes were reduced
(Shi et al.,
2009). A decreased activity level had been suggested as a
responsible mechanism for weight gain during weight cycling (Barbosa-da-Silva et al.,
2012). However, since overall activity rate was not
decreased during refeeding in the current study (data not shown), the
increased body weight is likely due to the higher total daily caloric
intake.

Both feeding microstructure and meal pattern showed that
previous experience with scheduled access to HFD had consequences for
behaviour during replacement and refeeding stages. When schedule-fed mice
were switched back to control feeding conditions during the replacement
phase, they retained a meal number appropriate to the consumption of larger
amounts of food during that 2-h schedule-fed period (Fig. 5A), had increased
caloric intake during that period (Fig. 2C), but returned to baseline meal size. When mice
were then returned to HFD during scheduled feeding in the refeeding phase,
they had an elevated caloric intake during scheduled feeding compared with
habituation. Firstly, this was due to an increased meal size (Fig. 5B), and secondly, intake
in the first 15 min following presentation of HFD was higher than during
habituation (Fig. 4B). In particular, on day 1 of the refeeding phase,
there was an elevated caloric intake during the first 15 min (Fig. 4C). It appears likely
that the mice were still anticipating HFD since they continued to exhibit
FAA prior to and during the scheduled feeding time throughout the
replacement phase.

Consistent with the persistent increase in activity during
the replacement phase, it has been shown previously that FAA can persist
following withdrawal of palatable diet from a palatable scheduled feeding
regime. In rats, for example, FAA persisted under ad
libitum feeding conditions for at least 7 days at the
expected time of a chocolate snack (Ángeles-Castellanos, Salgado-Delgado, Rodríguez, Buijs,
& Escobar, 2008), and for mice, an increased
food bin entry and high intensity activity continued after withdrawal of a
palatable high fat treat (Hsu
et al., 2010a). In contrast, FAA disappeared when a
period of ad libitum feeding followed a restricted
feeding schedule when chow was only available for 2 h or 3 h in the light
phase, but FAA was reinstated when rats were fasted (Ángeles-Castellanos et al.,
2008; Mistlberger, 1994). Mice, however, continued to exhibit
limited FAA under ad libitum feeding conditions
following the interruption of a restricted scheduled feeding regime of daily
4-h access to chow in the light phase (Blum et al., 2009). The FAA during
habituation, as well as the persistent FAA during replacement, indicates
that FAA might be driven by a FEO with a periodicity of 24 h but which does
not depend on signals of either hunger or nutritional origin.

Conclusions and possible mechanistic underpinning
of binge eating
Scheduled feeding on HFD stimulates a substantial binge
eating episode in this mouse model. However, the period immediately before
scheduled feeding is characterised by near normal levels of caloric intake
from stock diet. We have previously observed the same phenomenon in
schedule-fed rats (Bake et al.,
2014). The absence of relative negative energy balance,
in advance of the initiation of the binge, in either species, is in line
with our previous findings (Bake
et al., 2013) where there was no evidence of potentially
causative perturbation in expression of hypothalamic homeostatic
neuropeptide genes prior to consumption of large binge-type meals.
Similarly, analysis of the gut hormones, ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide-1
indicated that these hormones were not involved in the anticipation of large
palatable meals in rats (Bake
et al., 2014), whereas they have been implicated in the
anticipation of daily meals on restricted feeding schedules (Dailey et al., 2012;
Drazen, Vahl, D'Alessio,
Seeley, & Woods, 2006; Merkestein et al., 2012;
Vahl, Drazen, Seeley,
D'Alessio, & Woods, 2010). Two key findings of
the current study were the continuing presence of FAA and sustained increase
in meal frequency during the replacement phase, when only stock diet was
available and the immediate hyperphagic response once HFD was restored after
7 days. The presence of FAA suggests that this could be part of the priming
process for binge-like eating in the palatable schedule-fed model, which can
be initiated very rapidly once HFD becomes available again. Although the
mechanistic basis of FAA has not been definitively established, examination
of mouse lines suggests that this behavioural profile is not critically
dependent upon individual hormones or neuropeptides such as leptin
(Gunapala et al.,
2011; Ribeiro
et al., 2011), ghrelin, NPY or orexin (Gunapala et al., 2011), or
the histaminergic system (Liu
et al., 2012), although ghrelin receptor signalling might
be at least necessary to augment FAA (Blum et al., 2009; Davis et al., 2011), but may
require functional dopaminergic (Liu et al., 2012), serotonergic (Hsu et al., 2010b) or
melanocortin-3 receptor dependent signalling systems (Begriche et al., 2012;
Sutton et al.,
2008). This suggests an association between the
mechanisms underlying binge-like eating on a palatable diet and those
responsible for FAA, and highlights the value of palatable scheduled feeding
models for further investigation as we seek to gain additional insight into
the control of meal feeding and over-consumption of calories.
