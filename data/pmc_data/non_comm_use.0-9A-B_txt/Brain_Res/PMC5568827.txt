==== Body
The two corrections that are needed are both contained in the very early part in Section 2.1.

For this section, the word ‘weight’ is missing at the end of the subtitle. The correct text is
‘Mecp2−/y mice exhibited prototypical shortened
lifespan and reduced brain weight’.

The first sentence in 2.1 should read as follows ‘As shown in Fig. 1A, the lifespan of the
Mecp2−/y mice ranged from 49 to 91 days (n
= 19), with the median survival time being 61 days.’

The authors would like to apologise for any confusion caused by these oversights.
