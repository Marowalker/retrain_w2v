Ragweed pollen represents a major allergy risk factor. Ragweed
extracts contain five different isoforms of the major allergen Amb a 1.
However, the immunological characteristics of Amb a 1 isoforms are not fully
investigated. Here, we compared the physicochemical and immunological
properties of three most important Amb a 1 isoforms.

Methods
After purification, the isoforms were physicochemically
characterized, tested for antibody binding and induction of human T-cell
proliferative responses. Their immunological properties were further
evaluated in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model.

Results
Amb a 1 isoforms exhibited distinct patterns of IgE binding and
immunogenicity. Compared to Amb a 1.02 or 03 isoforms, Amb a 1.01 showed
higher IgE-binding activity. Isoforms 01 and 03 were the most potent
stimulators of patients’ T cells. In a mouse model of immunization,
Amb a 1.01 induced higher levels of IgG and IgE antibodies when compared to
isoforms 02 and 03. Interestingly, ragweed-sensitized patients also
displayed an IgG response to Amb a 1 isoforms. However, unlike
therapy-induced antibodies, sensitization-induced IgG did not show
IgE-blocking activity.

Conclusion
The present study showed that naturally occurring isoforms of Amb a 1
possess different immunogenic and sensitizing properties. These findings
should be considered when selecting sequences for molecule-based diagnosis
and therapy for ragweed allergy. Due to its high IgE-binding activity,
isoform Amb a 1.01 should be included in diagnostic tests. In contrast, due
to their limited B- and T-cell cross-reactivity patterns, a combination of
different isoforms might be a more attractive strategy for ragweed
immunotherapy.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Worldwide, pollen of short ragweed is recognized as a major allergy risk for
atopic individuals. Epidemiological studies showed that 23% to 32.8% of the US
population is sensitized to ragweed, whereas prevalence of sensitization in European
countries varies between 3.5% (eg, Italy) and 54% (eg, Hungary).1–3
A study in northern China showed that 6.5% of allergic patients responded positive
to ragweed pollen in skin prick tests.4 In
South America, 23% of Colombian patients with acute asthma displayed
ragweed-specific IgE antibodies.5

More than 95% of ragweed pollen-allergic patients display IgE antibodies
against the major allergen Amb a 1, which is a member of the pectate lyase
family.6 Allergenic pectate lyases have
also been identified as major allergens in the pollen of
Cupressaceae trees such as Mediterranean cypress, mountain
cedar, as well as Japanese cedar and cypress. Interestingly, IgE cross-reactivity
between ragweed and Cupressaceae pollen-derived pectate lyases has
been reported to be relatively low.7 To date,
five different Amb a 1 isoforms have been acknowledged by the WHO/IUIS allergen
nomenclature subcommittee (www.allergen.org) showing
sequence homologies between 63% and 87% (Fig. S1B).8

Previous studies showed that isoforms of certain major allergens display
distinct immunological properties. For example, isoforms of the major house dust
mite allergen Der p 2 diverge only by 3% in their amino acid sequences, but were
shown to differ in their IgE-binding properties and to induce different cytokine
patterns upon stimulation of PBMCs from allergic and nonallergic donors.9 Similarly, two isoforms of Bet v 1 with
sequence identity of 96% showed striking differences in their IgE-binding properties
and in their capacity to activate T cells from allergic patients.10 These differences seem to be linked to the
capacity of Bet v 1 isoform 0102 to form cysteine-linked aggregates11 and its fold dynamics. These properties,
which were demonstrated to be critical for binding to cathepsin S and for efficient
processing,12 are not shared by the Bet v
1.0101 isoform.

Recent reports suggested that Amb a 1 isoforms might display distinct
antibody binding properties.6,8 This prompted us to analyze in great detail
the allergenic as well as immunogenic properties of Amb a 1 isoforms. Understanding
the immunological and allergenic properties of individual isoforms comprising
natural Amb a 1 is of major importance for the development of adequate and efficient
products for diagnosis and therapy of ragweed pollen allergy.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Protein purification
Natural Amb a 1 was purified from 6 g of Ambrosia
artemisiifolia pollen (Batch: 020511204 purchased from Allergon AB,
Ängelholm, Sweden). Recombinant Amb a 1.03 was produced in the yeast
Pichia pastoris and purified from culture supernatants.
Methods are described in detail in Appendix S1.

2.2 Peptide analysis by nano-LC-MS/MS
Analyses of tryptic peptides obtained from ragweed pollen extracts and
from purified isoforms were performed as described in Appendix S1.

2.3 Physicochemical characterization
Physicochemical analyses were performed as described in Appendix S1.

2.4 Patients’ sera
Ragweed-allergic patients included in the study were identified based on
typical case history, positive skin prick test, and ImmunoCAP analysis (CAP w1
common ragweed Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Phadia, AB, Uppsala,
Sweden) (Table S1).
Experiments using anonymized serum samples from allergic patients were approved
by the ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna (Nr. 712/2010).

2.4.1 Proliferation assays: PBMC and TCC
T-cell recognition of Amb a 1 isoforms was assessed using peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and Amb a 1-specific T-cell clones (TCC)
isolated from ragweed-allergic patients.13 A detailed description is provided in Appendix S1.
Experiments using anonymized blood samples from allergic patients were
approved by the ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna (Nr.
497/2005).

2.5 Immunoblots and ELISA
Immunoblots and ELISA experiments were performed according to the
established protocols. A detailed description is provided in Appendix S1.

2.6 Mediator release assays
Mediator release assays were performed using RBL-2H3 cells transfected
with the alpha chain of the human IgE receptor14 and passively sensitized with IgE antibodies from
ragweed-allergic donors as described in Appendix S1.

2.7 Facilitated antigen-binding assay (FAB)
To determine Amb a 1 isoform-specific blocking capacity of
patients’ IgG and IgG of immunized mice toward Amb a 1-specific human
IgE, the FAB assay15,16 was used. A detailed description is
given in Appendix S1.

2.8 Animal experiments
Female BALB/c mice (Janvier Labs, Saint-Berthevin, France) at the age of
8 weeks were used for experiments (five animals/group). 5 μg of antigen
was either adsorbed to 50% Alu-Gel-S (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) v/v or
formulated without adjuvant in PBS pH 7.4, and administered as two 50 μL
s.c. injections, bilaterally in the lumbar region at days 0, 7, 14, and 21. Sera
were taken at days -2, 14, and 28. Specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies were
analyzed by ELISA as described in Appendix S1. IgE antibodies were analyzed in
mediator release assays. All animal experiments were conducted according to
National guidelines approved by the Austrian Ministry of Science
(BMWF-66.012/0009-II/3b/2013).

3 Results
3.1 Characterization of natural Amb a 1
Mass spectrometric analyses of ragweed pollen extracts showed that Amb a
1 comprised 78% of the allergen content (data not shown). Similar results were
reported in other studies.6,17 In addition, our analyses revealed that
the natural Amb a 1 mixture consisted of 33% of isoform 01, 16% of isoform 02,
11% of isoform 03, 6% of isoform 04, and 34% of isoform 05 (Table S2). As isoforms
01, 02, and 03 were shown to display higher IgE-binding activity than isoforms
04 and 05,8 they were selected for further
characterization.

3.2 Purification and physicochemical characterization of Amb a 1 isoforms
Isoforms 01, 02, and 03 were purified from ragweed pollen extracts by
standard chromatography. Isoform 03 was also produced as a recombinant protein
in P. pastoris. The purified Amb a 1 isoforms were able to
inhibit between 59% and 87% of the IgE binding to ragweed pollen extracts, as
determined in inhibition ELISA and immunoblot experiments (Figure 1B,C). After purification, the identity, purity, and
isoform composition of the preparations were confirmed by mass spectrometry
(Fig. S2). The nAmb
a 1.01 preparation was found to consist of 94% isoform 01, 4% isoform 04, and 1%
isoform 02. The nAmb a 1.02 preparation consisted of 86% isoform 02 and 12%
isoform 01. The natural preparation of Amb a 1.03 contained 87% of isoform 03
and 8% of isoform 01. Recombinant isoform 03 had a purity of >99%. Using
sera from ragweed-allergic patients in immunoblots, cross-inhibition ELISA, and
mediator release assays, no significant differences in the IgE-binding
properties of recombinant and natural isoform 03 could be detected (Fig. S3). Due to low
purification yields of the natural form (40 μg/g pollen), the recombinant
form of isoform 03 was selected for further experiments. As determined by the
HEK-Blue™ mTLR4 reporter cell assay, the levels of endotoxin in isoforms
01 and 03 preparations were below the detection limit of 6.1 EU/mg, whereas for
Amb a 1.02 a value of 166 EU/mg was measured.

The secondary structure elements of the three Amb a 1 isoforms were
analyzed using CD and FTIR (Fig. S4). The CD spectra showed the typical shape of proteins with
high beta-sheet content in combination with a large portion of unordered
structures. The CD patterns indicated that each isoform possessed distinct
structural features, which was further confirmed by FTIR experiments. The major
structural element in the family 1 of polysaccharide lyases (www.cazy.org) is a central parallel beta-helix. This is clearly
indicated by the observed high beta-sheet content (35.6%-40.5%) in all isoforms.
The molecules also displayed variable content of alpha helical structures, that
is, 11.5%, 22.7%, and 15.4% for isoforms 01, 02, and 03, respectively. Based on
these results, it seems reasonable to suggest that the overall structures of Amb
a 1 isoforms differ significantly (Fig. S1C).

3.3 Amb a 1.01 shows higher IgE-binding activity than isoforms 02 and 03
Antibody-binding profiles of 39 ragweed-allergic patients were analyzed
by immunoblot and ELISA assays. Of the 39 patients, seven individuals received
ragweed-specific immunotherapy (+AIT). In immunoblots, the majority (87%) of the
patients reacted with Amb a 1 (Fig. S5A). ELISA experiments showed that 97% of the patients were
sensitized to Amb a 1 (Fig.
S5B), but no significant differences in the binding of IgE, IgG1, or
IgG4 to the tested Amb a 1 isoforms could be detected (Figure 2A-C). However, in mediator release assays, isoform
01 was found to react significantly stronger than the other isoforms. 0.61,
1.83, and 1.46 ng/mL of isoforms 01, 02, and 03, respectively, were necessary to
induce half-maximal release (Figure
2D).

3.4 Amb a 1-specific IgG4 antibodies from non-AIT patients do not show
IgE-blocking activity
The IgE-blocking activity of sensitization- versus therapy-induced IgG
antibodies was evaluated using the FAB assay. We selected five non-AIT patients
and compared them with seven AIT patients. All patients (non-AIT and AIT) showed
high levels of Amb a 1-specific IgG4 recognizing each isoform. In six of seven
AIT patients, IgG-blocking activity could be detected, but their blocking
capacity did not correlate with IgG antibody levels. Remarkably, in contrast to
therapy-induced IgGs, sensitization-induced specific IgGs showed no IgE-blocking
activity (Figure 2E,F).

3.5 Amb a 1.01 shows high immunogenicity in mice
To investigate the immunological properties of Amb a 1 isoforms in vivo,
mice were immunized using two immunization schedules, with and without ALUM as
adjuvant (Figure 3A). In both immunization
protocols, isoform 01 was the most potent antigen inducing the highest IgG1
titers. Moreover, the onset of the immune response against isoform 01 was faster
compared to the other tested antigens. In the presence of ALUM, immunization
with isoform 03 induced higher IgG2a titers than with isoforms 01 or 02, whereas
in the absence of ALUM, higher titers were observed with isoform 01 (Figure 3B,C; Table S3).

3.6 Amb a 1.01 isoform is a very potent allergen
In mediator release assays, we found that adsorption to ALUM had only
minor effects on the induction of IgE specific for isoforms 01 and 02, whereas
the IgE response against isoform 03 was boosted in the absence of ALUM. Both in
the presence and in the absence of ALUM, isoform 01 was the most potent inducer
of IgE, as indicated by the low protein amounts (0.05 ng protein/mL without
ALUM; 0.18 ng protein/mL with ALUM) needed to trigger half-maximal mediator
release in basophils (Figure 3B, C).

3.7 Isoform-induced antibodies show limited cross-reactivity
The degree of cross-inhibition between the individual isoforms was
investigated using sera from ragweed-allergic patients. Isoform 01 showed the
highest cross-IgE inhibition capacity followed by isoform 02. Isoform 03 showed
very low capacity of cross-inhibition (Figures
1A, Fig.
S6).

Cross-reactivity was further investigated in the mouse immunization
model. Isoform 01-induced antibodies (IgG1 and IgG2a) showed very little
cross-reactivity with the other two isoforms (Figure 4A). In contrast, immunization with isoform 02 induced highly
cross-reactive antibodies (Figure 4B).
Antibodies induced by isoform 03 were moderately cross-reactive (Figure 4C). Similar to the results obtained
in human IgE cross-inhibition ELISA, sera from single isoform-immunized mice
showed limited cross-reactivity when stimulated with other isoforms in RBL
mediator release assays (Figure 4). Taken
together, the results indicate that both IgE and IgG antibodies induced by
natural sensitization with Amb a 1 isoforms in humans or by immunization in
mouse display distinct patterns of epitope recognition.

3.8 Proliferation assays with PBMC
Amb a 1 isoforms were tested for their capacity to induce proliferation
in PBMCs from seven ragweed-allergic patients. PBMCs were stimulated with three
different concentrations (0.6, 1.25, and 2.5 μg/mL) of Amb a 1 isoforms.
Higher and stronger proliferative responses were obtained upon stimulation with
Amb a 1.01 and 1.03, when compared with Amb a 1.02 (Figure 5B).

3.9 Amb a 1.03-specific T-cell clones
Five Amb a 1.03-reactive TCC obtained from three different
ragweed-allergic donors were specific for five independent epitope regions of
Amb a 1.03 (epitope sequences are indicated in Figure 5A).13 Four of five
TCC also reacted to Amb a 1.02 and only two of five to Amb a 1.01. These results
suggest that at the T-cell level, isoforms 02 and 03 have the highest
cross-reactivity level, in conformity with their higher sequence identity.

3.10 Mouse antibodies block human IgE binding to Amb a 1 in an isoform-specific
manner
To analyze the epitope profile and IgE-blocking capacity of mouse
antibodies induced by immunization with Amb a 1 isoforms, we performed FAB
assays (schematic in Figure 6A). Mouse sera
were incubated with the different isoforms and a pool of human indicator serum
containing high levels of Amb a 1-specific IgE antibodies. IgE–allergen
complex formation was determined by flow cytometry and expressed as % of cells
carrying such complexes. For isoform 01, 90.9% cells carried such complexes,
76.3% for isoform 02 and 86% for isoform 03. After the addition of serum from
isoform 01-immunized mice, the percentage of cells carrying IgE–isoform
01 complexes decreased to 1.1%, demonstrating high self-blocking capacity
(98.8%). Similarly, sera from isoforms 02- and 03-immunized animals achieved
almost 100% blocking activity against their respective complexes (96.3% and
95.6%, respectively). In contrast, sera from isoforms 02- and 03-immunized mice
showed very limited capacity (28.6% and 7.7%, respectively) to block the
formation of IgE–isoform 01 complexes. Sera from isoform 01-immunized
mice showed very low blocking activity against isoforms 02 and 03 (24.8% and
3.6%, respectively). Experiments using combinations of isoform-specific mouse
sera showed that only an equal mix of sera containing antibodies against all
three isoforms resulted in high blocking capacity (Figure 6B).

4 Discussion
Amb a 1, the most abundant allergen in ragweed pollen, is composed of a
mixture of five isoforms with amino acid sequence identities ranging between 63% and
87%. The clinical relevance of Amb a 1 has been documented in numerous publications:
(i) A study by Zeiss et al. 18 showed that as
much as 13% of the total serum IgE in ragweed-allergic patients is specific for Amb
a 1; (ii) the content of Amb a 1 (formerly antigen E) in pollen extracts nicely
correlates with the potency of the extract, as determined by skin prick tests in
ragweed-allergic patients19; (iii)
immunotherapy with purified Amb a 1 was shown to be as effective as whole ragweed
extract in reducing symptoms induced by pollen exposure.20 Thus, clinical data strongly suggest that despite the fact
that during the sensitization process individuals develop IgE antibodies to several
molecules found in ragweed extracts, from the point of view of patients’
immunotherapy, Amb a 1 represents the most important allergen. In fact, in contrast
to Amb a 1 isoforms, our experiments demonstrated that the minor allergens Amb a 8
and Amb a 9 display very low IgE inhibition capacity toward coated ragweed pollen
extract. In these experiments, isoforms 01 and 02 showed the highest capacity to
inhibit IgE binding (up to 87% of total ragweed-specific IgE) to coated ragweed
pollen extract. As our results presented here as well as published data showed that
Amb a 1 isoforms 01, 02, and 03 bind most of the patients0 ragweed-specific
IgE,8,21 our study focused on the characterization of these three
isoforms.

Amb a 1-allergic patients receiving AIT showed high levels of IgG
(especially IgG4) against all Amb a 1 isoforms, which is an expected effect of the
therapy. However, many of the non-AIT patients showed Amb a 1-specific IgG1 and more
surprisingly also IgG4 antibodies. Recent studies with large birth cohorts have also
found IgG antibodies to a wide variety of allergens.22,23 However, in the study by
Schwarz et al., IgG4 antibodies against airborne allergens were rarely found.22 In this respect, it should be noted that in
the MAS birth cohort study, antibodies have been tested at the age of 2 years.22 This could provide an explanation for
discrepancies on the detection of allergen-specific IgG4 antibodies, as IgG4
antibody production seems to depend on repeated antigen stimulation for longer
periods of time.24 Nevertheless, the
occurrence of allergen-specific IgG4 in treated and nontreated ragweed-allergic
patients raises the question on the beneficial effects (eg, blocking activity)
attributed to this antibody class in immunotherapy.25 Our results using functional FAB assay revealed that only AIT-induced
IgG antibodies had a blocking effect on IgE. In contrast, sensitization-induced IgGs
were not able to block specific IgE–Amb a 1 interactions. In line with a
recent study by Hoh et al. describing somatic hypermutations and affinity maturation
of IgG4 during immunotherapy,26 our results
argue for an important role of IgG4 in the outcome of immunotherapy and suggest the
use of a functional assay capable of measuring the IgE–IgG interplay27 to monitor patients undergoing
allergen-specific immunotherapy.

To further investigate the sensitization capacity of the different Amb a 1
isoforms, we immunized mice in the presence and absence of ALUM as adjuvant. Isoform
01 was the most potent sensitizer, inducing very high levels of IgG and IgE
antibodies, followed by isoform 03. However, isoform 01-specific antibodies were
less cross-reactive than antibodies induced by immunizations with isoform 02 or 03.
Interestingly, the allergenic properties of Amb a 1 isoforms were not significantly
influenced by adsorption to ALUM as adjuvant. The differences in the
cross-reactivity patterns of the isoforms might be due to distinct surface
characteristics. Indeed, three-dimensional models showed that the surface of each
isoform has a unique fingerprint of charged and polar patches (Fig. S1C), which in turn
could result in distinct antibody-binding epitopes. In the mouse model, isoform 02
showed the highest level of cross-reactivity, whereas in cross-inhibition ELISA
experiments with human sera, isoform 01 had the greatest inhibitory capacity toward
the other isoforms.

The capacity of the different Amb a 1 isoforms to induce proliferation of T
cells from ragweed-allergic donors was assessed in PBMCs and Amb a 1-specific TCC.
Amb a 1 01 and 03 were the most potent stimulants of PBMCs, which is in good
agreement with their higher sensitizing capacity in our mouse immunization models.
Interestingly, Amb a 1.03-specific TCC showed very limited cross-reactivity upon
stimulation with isoform 01. Thus, limited cross-reactivity between isoforms 01 and
03 is observed both at B- and T-cell level, in humans and in mice. In general,
despite its low allergenicity/immunogenicity, isoform 02 showed high degree of B-
and T-cell cross-reactivity.

Taken together, our results raise the question whether a single Amb a 1
isoform would be sufficient for a molecule-based approach in ragweed immunotherapy.
Consequently, successful AIT for ragweed-allergic patients will likely depend on the
careful selection of Amb a 1 isoforms for a therapeutic cocktail. In principle, the
variable surfaces of the Amb a 1 isoforms could explain the differences observed in
their antibody cross-reactivity properties and sensitization capacity. However,
further experiments are needed to unequivocally demonstrate the relationship between
the isoform structures and their immunogenicity/allergenicity.
