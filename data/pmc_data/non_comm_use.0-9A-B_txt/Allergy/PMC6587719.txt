1 To the Editor,

Improvements in asthma outcomes have stalled over the past decade,1 which may be attributed to treating patients on the basis of a generic diagnostic label. The taxonomy “Treatable Traits” was proposed by Agusti et al (2016) as a precision medicine approach for the diagnosis and management of chronic airway diseases that is based on the identification of genetic, phenotypic and psychosocial characteristics for which therapeutic interventions are known to improve respiratory health.2 The Unbiased Biomarkers for the Prediction of Respiratory Disease Outcomes (U‐BIOPRED) project was set up to identify multidimensional phenotypes and endotypes in severe asthma.3 Here, we aim to identify and quantify treatable traits within the severe and mild/moderate U‐BIOPRED adult asthma cohorts3 and across previously identified phenotypes.4 We hypothesize that treatable traits will be more common in severe asthma and vary significantly across asthma phenotypes.

Data from the severe asthma and mild/moderate asthma cohorts of the U‐BIOPRED project were included in this study. Full details of the study population and methodology have been presented elsewhere.3 Criteria for treatable traits were based on Agusti et al2 and presented in Table 1. Chi‐squared tests were used to examine differences in the prevalence of each treatable trait between groups and independent sample t tests used to determine differences in the total number of traits between cohorts. No adjustment for multiple testing was applied as the analyses were considered exploratory; as this may inflate the type‐1 error rate, individual P values are presented for each comparison. A post hoc power calculation shows our sample of 421 (severe smoking/ex‐smoking vs severe nonsmoking) and 399 (severe nonsmoking vs mild/moderate) is sufficient to identify a difference in treatable trait prevalence between cohorts with a medium effect size (0.3) and a power close to 1.00. Data analysis was supported by IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24.0. Armonk, NY, USA, with significance set at P < 0.05, unless otherwise stated.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd2 PREVALENCE OF TREATABLE TRAITS
Twenty‐three treatable traits were identified, including seven pulmonary, 11 extra‐pulmonary and five behavioural/psychosocial treatable traits (Table 2). Seven out of the ten most prevalent traits in severe asthma were classed as pulmonary treatable traits. The most prevalent extra‐pulmonary traits were as follows: atopy, rhinosinusitis, obesity, reflux and obstructive sleep apnoea. Poor adherence to medication, anxiety and depression were the most common behavioural/psychosocial treatable traits in severe asthma.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd3 DIFFERENCES IN TREATABLE TRAITS ACROSS ASTHMA COHORTS
The severe smoking/ex‐smoking asthma cohort displayed on average one more treatable trait than the severe nonsmoking asthma cohort (8 ± 3 vs 7 ± 2, P = 0.007). Differences in the prevalence of individual traits, all higher in the smoking/ex‐smoking cohort, were seen in bronchodilator reversibility, fixed airflow limitation (P = 0.050), reflux, cardiovascular disease and psychiatric disease. Only atopy was higher in prevalence in the nonsmoking cohort.

Nonsmoking individuals with severe asthma have more treatable traits than nonsmoking individuals with mild/moderate asthma (7 ± 2 vs 5 ± 2, P < 0.001). Likewise, individual treatable traits were generally more common in nonsmoking severe asthma compared to the mild/moderate asthma cohort. Only in atopy and poor medication adherence was the prevalence of the treatable trait significantly higher in mild/moderate asthma. The prevalence of treatable traits across previously identified clusters4 is presented and discussed on the Appendix S1.

4 DISCUSSION
The identification of treatable traits facilitates a precision medicine strategy for the management of airways disease, that is free from the traditional diagnostic labels and based on the identification of pulmonary, extra‐pulmonary and psychosocial characteristics, for which there are evidence‐based therapeutic choices. This proposal was recently supported by the Lancet commission “After asthma: redefining airways disease”5 and was a favoured strategy to move the field towards precision medicine at a research seminar, held at the European Respiratory Society's annual meeting.6 Ours is the first study to apply the concept to a large asthma cohort, and we have identified a plethora of pulmonary, extra‐pulmonary and behavioural / psychosocial treatable traits. The prevalence of treatable traits, both pulmonary and nonpulmonary, was generally higher in individuals with severe asthma compared to mild/moderate asthma. We also identified a difference in the prevalence of pulmonary treatable traits across clinical clusters of patients. Approximately 5%‐10% of asthmatics remain poorly controlled, despite being prescribed the maximum dose of therapy.7 Our data suggest individuals with severe asthma, who remain symptomatic despite receiving a high dose ICS, display on average seven treatable traits, and therefore present multiple treatment opportunities beyond the traditional stepwise approach.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, pulmonary traits accounted for seven of the ten most prevalent treatable traits in our asthma cohorts and were generally more common in severe asthma. Interestingly, however, we also observed an increased prevalence of extra‐pulmonary and behavioural/psychosocial traits in severe asthma suggesting an association with asthma severity, which may reflect the impact of living with severe chronic respiratory conditions. Our data highlight that multiple treatment opportunities exist beyond the pulmonary system, and a holistic management strategy, such as the treatable trait approach, may be beneficial to both physical and mental well‐being.

This is the first study to apply the concept of treatable traits to a large asthma cohort. Several limitations are worthy of discussion; firstly, we utilized the original paper on treatable traits,2 treatment guidelines and clinical experience to determine the classification criteria for our treatable traits. We acknowledge that our list of traits is not exhaustive and that the selected criteria for some traits could be contentious. Prospective studies would benefit from additional paraclinical investigations to determine the prevalence of additional treatable traits, for example ventilation heterogeneity and small airway disease. Finally, we acknowledge that some traits may not be mutually exclusive and some maybe modified by asthma treatment. Associations between traits were not explored here but have been discussed elsewhere.8


In conclusion, the label‐free, precision medicine approach provided by the treatable traits construct allowed for the identification of multiple treatment opportunities for patients with asthma, beyond the traditional stepwise approach. We eagerly await the results of prospective, longitudinal, clinical trials to determine whether this translates to improved clinical outcomes for individuals with respiratory disease.
